The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel.[245] While the Queen is in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurs on a daily basis.[246] The Royal Ascot procession leaves the castle each year during the annual meeting.[247]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first was Prafulla Chandra Ghosh of the Indian National Congress, who was succeeded by his party-mates Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy and Prafulla Chandra Sen. A decade of instability followed, marred by fractious coalition governments and frequent impositions of President's rule. The instability ended with 1977 election victory of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM). Headed by Jyoti Basu, the CPM-led Left Front government was in office for over 23 years (1977â€“2000). Left rule in West Bengal continued for another 10 years under Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, before its defeat in the 2011 election by the Trinamool Congress.

Comparison of EEG bands

Band
Frequency (Hz)
Location
Normally
Pathologically


Delta
< 4
frontally in adults, posteriorly in children; high-amplitude waves


adult slow-wave sleep
in babies
Has been found during some continuous-attention tasks[49]




subcortical lesions
diffuse lesions
metabolic encephalopathy hydrocephalus
deep midline lesions




Theta
4–7
Found in locations not related to task at hand


higher in young children
drowsiness in adults and teens
idling
Associated with inhibition of elicited responses (has been found to spike in situations where a person is actively trying to repress a response or action).[49]




focal subcortical lesions
metabolic encephalopathy
deep midline disorders
some instances of hydrocephalus




Alpha
8–15
posterior regions of head, both sides, higher in amplitude on dominant side. Central sites (c3-c4) at rest


relaxed/reflecting
closing the eyes
Also associated with inhibition control, seemingly with the purpose of timing inhibitory activity in different locations across the brain.




coma




Beta
16–31
both sides, symmetrical distribution, most evident frontally; low-amplitude waves


range span: active calm → intense → stressed → mild obsessive
active thinking, focus, high alert, anxious




benzodiazepines
Dup15q syndrome [50]




Gamma
> 32
Somatosensory cortex


Displays during cross-modal sensory processing (perception that combines two different senses, such as sound and sight)[51][52]
Also is shown during short-term memory matching of recognized objects, sounds, or tactile sensations




A decrease in gamma-band activity may be associated with cognitive decline, especially when related to the theta band; however, this has not been proven for use as a clinical diagnostic measurement




Mu
8–12
Sensorimotor cortex


Shows rest-state motor neurons.[53]




Mu suppression could indicate that motor mirror neurons are working. Deficits in Mu suppression, and thus in mirror neurons, might play a role in autism.[54]

58,Dog and pony show,where does the term dog and pony show come from,"The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events.[2] Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was “Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show,” started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled “Gentry’s Equine and Canine Paradox.” It started small, but evolved into a full circus show.[3] Other early dog and pony shows included Morris’ Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt’s Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).[citation needed]",NONE,in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,History of Islam,who is recognized as the founder of islam,"According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570.[24] His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran, enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day, and castigate social injustices of his city.[5] Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca.[6] In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers.[25] Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra, as the start of the Islamic era.[26]",NONE,Muhammad,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dust from natural sources, usually large areas of land with little or no vegetation
Methane, emitted by the digestion of food by animals, for example cattle
Radon gas from radioactive decay within the Earth's crust. Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive noble gas that is formed from the decay of radium. It is considered to be a health hazard. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as the basement and it is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking.
Smoke and carbon monoxide from wildfires
Vegetation, in some regions, emits environmentally significant amounts of Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on warmer days. These VOCs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants—specifically, NOx, SO2, and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds — to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants.[20] Black gum, poplar, oak and willow are some examples of vegetation that can produce abundant VOCs. The VOC production from these species result in ozone levels up to eight times higher than the low-impact tree species.[21]

An example is if one says: ""I may agree that if two plus two equals five, then I am a monkey's uncle"". ""I'll be a monkey's uncle"" has been said to date from after 1925, the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States, where the term first appears.[2] The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest example is the phrase If that's a joke I'm a monkey's uncle, from an Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925.[3] It was originally a sarcastic remark made by creationists.[4] The notion ""that [people] were descended from apes was considered blasphemous...by Darwin's contemporaries"", and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use.[5]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

89,Tower of London,what was the tower of london originally used for,"The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins),[3] although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2000 and 2001, the company addressed staffing and infrastructure issues related to this rapid growth by implementing a more rigorous recruitment strategy and introducing new technology, including an order-placement system.[15] From the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the company focused on opening new locations in residential areas to attract local residents and workers as customers.[13] It updated its marketing in 2006 to encourage new customers, changing the design of its highway billboard advertisements to include images of menu items. Previously the signs had featured only the company's logo.[16] By 2011, Cracker Barrel had opened more than 600 restaurants in 42 states.[17][18][19] On January 17, 2012, company founder Dan Evins died of bladder cancer.[20]

152,Rain shadow,what effect do the atlas mountains have on rainfall,"The Sahara Desert is made even drier because of two strong rain shadow effects caused by some major mountains ranges (whose highest points can culminate to more than 4,000 meters high). To the northwest, the Atlas Mountains, covering the Mediterranean coast for Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia as well as to the southeast with the Ethiopian Highlands, located in Ethiopia around the Horn of Africa. On the windward side of the Atlas Mountains, the warm, moist winds blowing from the northwest off the Atlantic Ocean which contain a lot of water vapor are forced to rise, lift up and expand over the mountain range. This causes them to cool down, which causes an excess of moisture to condense into high clouds and results in heavy precipitation over the mountain range. This is known as orographic rainfall and after this process, the air is dry because it has lost most of its moisture over the Atlas Mountains. On the leeward side, the cold, dry air starts to descend and to sink and compress, making the winds warm up. This warming causes the moisture to evaporate, making clouds disappear. This prevents rainfall formation and creates desert conditions in the Sahara. The same phenomenon occurs in the Ethiopian Highlands, but this rain shadow effect is even more pronounced because this mountain range is larger, with the tropical Monsoon of South Asia coming from the Indian Ocean and from the Arabian Sea. These produce clouds and rainfall on the windward side of the mountains, but the leeward side stays rain shadowed and extremely dry. This second extreme rain shadow effect partially explains the extreme aridity of the eastern Sahara Desert, which is the driest and the sunniest place on the planet. Similar levels of aridity and dryness are only seen in the Atacama Desert, located in Chile and Peru.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An average detective from a low crime precinct mutually despised by Sipowicz, who called him ""Dutch Boy"" in reference to a plaster marketing statue he once shot in the dark thinking it was a suspect with a gun. He threw his son out of the house when John Jr. decided to work at the 15th with Andy; his partner and he later worked a case with Clark Jr. and Andy that revealed Clark Sr.'s by-the-book approach and hyper-sensitivity to his son being anything like Andy. (In fact, Andy was much more the kind of detective Clark Jr. wanted to be, which is why he chose to transfer to the 15th when he earned a detective's shield and pick of assignments.) Clark Sr. later got busted for sleeping with a prostitute and let his son face the IAB accusation and potential discipline until Andy told him Clark Jr. was on the verge of being fired, which caused Clark Sr. to confess. After this, Clark Sr. began drinking heavily and became an IAB informant, which nearly ruined John's career at the 15th. His actions helped lead to the campaign by Officer Laughlin against Clark Jr., who finally told his father to stop making bad decisions on his behalf and stop drinking so much.

Link can return to 6:00 am on the first day by playing the ""Song of Time"" on the Ocarina of Time. If he does not before the 72 hours expire, then the moon will destroy Clock Town, including all the surrounding regions of Termina and Link will lose everything he accomplished during these three days. A real-time countdown will begin when only 6 hours remain.[6] However, returning to the first day saves the player's progress and major accomplishments permanently, such as the acquisition of maps, masks, musical tracks, and weapons.[8] Cleared puzzles, keys, and minor items will be lost, as well as any rupees not in the bank, and almost all characters will have no recollection of meeting Link.[9] Link can slow down time or warp to the next morning or evening by playing two variations of the Song of Time. Owl statues scattered across certain major areas of the world allow the player to temporarily save their progress once they have been activated, and also provide warp points to quickly move around the world.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neal Avron handled production duties. Commenting on the record's lyrical themes, Wentz said the lyrics were about ""the anxiety and depression that goes along with looking at your own life.""[5] In support of their release the group headlined tours worldwide and played at various music festivals.

The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach.[8] When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.[8]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling.[citation needed] Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, to tenderize the meat and maintain moisture.

Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as ""long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general"" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it ""felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap"". The iPhone 5 was described as ""elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn’t really look like anything else on the market at the time"". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.

Ray takes on a job from Paige Finney. He is to find Carl LaFell, the husband of a woman that a football star has been having an affair with and pay him off.

When Ray realises this, he demands a check for the money – which Malcolm Finney pays out. Finney also offers to buy Ray and his firm, but Donovan says he is not for sale. Ray takes the check to LaFell who says he doesn’t want it. Ray persists, only to be rewarded with a series of punches. Avi offers Lena a partnership in his new business.

This apparition will haunt him throughout the day.

Daryll is soon overwhelmed with the role but Bunchy arrives and helps out. Ray is visited by Finney’s men who try, but fail, to bring him onto the payroll. Mickey and Ray try different approaches to get Terry out of prison before he is killed by the Aryan gang for killing one of their members in a prison fight. Both try and fail at the prison and Mickey ends up inadvertently killing the judge, who had already turned down cash from Ray. In desperation, Ray turns to Finney, who, in turn, leans on a reluctant Governor Verona, ensuring Terry is released that evening. Ray repays Finney by signing up to work for him. The girls return to a troubled Mickey, who is glum even upon seeing his large cut of the action. Ray calls, saying Terry will be freed. Mickey then cheers up, and claims joint responsibility for the release to Bunchy and Daryll. Ray collects Terry from the prison.

Mickey is required by Detective Muncie to work with them on a sting operation against the Minassians and their Russian supplier of trafficked girls, Ivan Belikov. Preparations for Bunchy’s wedding are underway but at the rehearsal dinner Ray gives less a best man’s speech, more a mumbled couple of sentences. Ray has Lena check out Teresa and family, who are mostly clean. Terry’s Parkinson’s (or meds) give him nightmares and when checking out the noise Abby and Ray find a shaken and embarrassed Terry has wet the bed. The NFL is checking the Finneys' deal and the absence of Varick leads them to have one of their investigators, disgraced former FBI director Ed Cochran, look into the deal. Cochran seems to relish the prospect of encountering Ray again. Mickey hides out in a motel. Muncie goes looking for him and arrests groom-to-be Bunchy when Mickey cannot be located. Ray agrees with Muncie to swap father for brother, then tracks down Mickey and convinces him to return. Mickey meets with the Minassians and sees the pictures of the sex-slaves that Belikov is controlling; he is shaken by these. Bridget is out bowling with Donellen who admits his feelings for her. Bunchy and Teresa are married and the reception is a success with Ray delivering a fine and moving speech. Mickey asks Ray for help with his situation. Ray asks Lena to look into the Minassians.

Ray is planning to get Mickey out of his sticky situation with the cops by working with old employer Lee Drexler. Ray gets Lee to act as a legal representative for Mickey. Their angle is to say that Mickey is senile, which is signed off on by a doctor whom they pay, and then appoint Ray as his guardian. That means that Mickey can’t rightfully participate in Muncie’s sting. Ray also tries to convince the Minassians to let Mickey out of the deal they made, and asks for help from an Armenian pop star whom Ray had helped out in the past. Meanwhile, Cochran is gathering more evidence in his investigation of Ray, using the vetting of the Finney NFL deal as a reason to dig into any potential dirty business. Cochran is getting closer to learning the truth. He meets with Finney, gets a sense of where he stands, and also bribes his way into Avi’s storage locker. Worried about Bridget, Abby searches her room for something that will help her figure out what’s wrong. She finds Mr. Donellen’s pill bottle and confronts Bridget about it. When Abby learns the truth, she first threatens to call the cops. Donellen lies to Abby telling her that Bridget is obsessed with him because they both lost loved ones.

Cochran sends the LAPD, via their website, a map of where Varick’s body is buried, his screen observed remotely by Avi and Lena. He then plants the poker at Ray's apartment and has Finney tell the police chief that it was Ray who killed Varick. Finney asks Paige to back him up. Avi calls Ray and they agree the body should be moved. Ray answers some of a detective’s questions about Varick, but Lee Drexler arrives and concludes the conversation. Lee tells Ray that Finney had implicated him; Ray sees Finney’s lawyer and tells him to have Finney recant his statement. Cochran arrives home to find Ray there, Ray asks where the poker is, but it takes a bullet to the leg and some persuasion to get the location. Ray recovers the poker just before the police arrive – Lena speeds it away. Bridget, though grounded, visits Donellen and tells him how she feels but he gently rebuffs her. Abby arrives and takes Bridget away. Terry makes a pass at Abby. Ray intercepts Paige on her way into the LAPD offices and he tries to convince her to tell the truth. She tells the police that Finney killed Varick and that they were lovers. Ray and his team deposit the body and poker in a dumpster at Finney’s home. Paige tells Finney she made her statement, but not its contents, and Lena torches the body. Ray and his team return a bruised Cochran to Dybek. Mickey avoids having to move to Reno by convincing his boys he has Alzheimer’s, and claims that he is scared that Ray will lock him away somewhere. Ray confronts Mickey, and Mickey tells Ray they will all hate him if he is sent away, forcing Ray to relent.

212,Objective correlative,who gave the famous objective co relative theory,"The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot, who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics. Helping define the objective correlative, Eliot's essay ""Hamlet and His Problems"",[1] republished in his book The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare's incomplete development of Hamlet's emotions in the play Hamlet. Eliot uses Lady Macbeth's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative  : ""The artistic 'inevitability' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion…."" , as a contrast to Hamlet. According to Eliot, the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him. The objective correlative's purpose is to express the character's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as ""...perhaps little more than the ancient distinction (first made by Plato) between mimesis and diegesis…."" (28). According to Formalist critics, this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work.

The design fell from favor through the 20th century as larger gaps were bridged using pure suspension designs, and shorter ones using various systems built of reinforced concrete.

However, tickets are often sold online, either by the bus companies themselves or by portals and print-outs of confirmation emails are used as tickets.[citation needed] Except in Boston, the lines rarely use stations of their own. Passengers are usually directed to wait along a given curbside for the arrival of the bus, although many companies offer waiting areas at or near the pickup points. Several bus stops are also near major hotels and in the parking areas of major Chinese supermarkets.[citation needed] In New York, several bus lines pick up passengers on a stretch of Forsyth Street at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in the Little Fuzhou neighborhood within Manhattan's Chinatown.[7] Since 1998, when the New York City Department of Transportation marked the strip a bus layover area, the sidewalk between Division Street and East Broadway has served as a de facto terminal for the Chinatown buses.[7][27]",NONE,Forsyth Street at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in the Little Fuzhou neighborhood within Manhattan's Chinatown,the sidewalk between Division Street and East Broadway,,,,,,,,,,,

294,Main sequence,how does a star become a main sequence,"After condensation of mass and ignition of a star, it generates thermal energy in the dense core region through nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. During this stage of the star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

346,Thomas J. Watson,who said i think there is a world market for maybe five computers,"Although Watson is well known for his alleged 1943 statement, ""I think there is a world market for maybe five computers,"" there is scant evidence he said it. Author Kevin Maney tried to find the origin of the quote, but has been unable to locate any speeches or documents of Watson's that contain this, nor are the words present in any contemporary articles about IBM. One of the very first attributions may be found in The Experts Speak, a book written by Christopher Cerf and Victor S. Navasky in 1984, however Cerf and Navasky just quote from a book written by Morgan and Langford, Facts and Fallacies. Another early article source (May 15, 1985) is a column by Neil Morgan, a San Diego Evening Tribune writer who wrote: ""Forrest Shumway, chairman of The Signal Cos., doesn't make predictions. His role model is Tom Watson, then IBM chairman, who said in 1958: 'I think there is a world market for about five computers.'"" The earliest known citation on the Internet is from 1986 on Usenet in the signature of a poster from Convex Computer Corporation as ""'I think there is a world market for about five computers' â€”Remark attributed to Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines), 1943"". All these early quotes are questioned by Eric Weiss, an editor of the Annals of the History of Computing in ACS letters in 1985.[24][full citation needed]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

356,Albatross (metaphor),the rime of the ancient mariner albatross symbolism,"It is an allusion to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798).[1] In the poem, an albatross starts to follow a ship â€” being followed by an albatross was generally considered a sign of good luck. However, the titular mariner shoots the albatross with a crossbow, which is regarded as an act that will curse the ship (which indeed suffers terrible mishaps). Even when they are too thirsty to speak, the ship's crew let the mariner know through their glances that they blame his action for the curse. The albatross is then literally hung around the mariner's neck by the crew to symbolize his guilt in killing the bird. Thus, the albatross can be both an omen of good or bad luck, as well as a metaphor for a burden to be carried as penance.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They eventually reach the sanctuary, but the well spring that is supposed to revive the Commission has been affected by the fritz. Moon urges Star to stay in the Sanctuary, to which she objects until Moon reveals that Toffee killed her mother. She then begins telling Star the story of how she defeated Toffee with help from Eclipsa, who she reveals is still alive.

Moon shares her story revolving around the death of her mother (Star's grandmother) at the hand of Toffee when she was a teenager. Moon was set to decide between signing a peace treaty or going to war against the monster army, led by Toffee. Since Toffee is immortal, Moon approaches Eclipsa, who is revealed to have been held in suspended animation inside a crystal prison for 300 years, to learn a dark magic that can destroy him. They forge a magic pact; in return for Eclipsa teaching Moon the magic, she would be set free once Toffee is defeated. She then confronts Toffee and uses the dark magic. However, it misses and only severs his finger, which he is unable to regenerate. Seeing their immortal leader wounded causes the monster army to panic and flee with Toffee following suit.

Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer's resignation, the majority leaders (Bruno, Skelos and Smith) have acted as lieutenant governors.

The dispute ended July 9, 2009, when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader, while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore, and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date.

Castiel then reveals that Sam's soul is not with him and is still trapped in Lucifer's Cage.[50][51] It is revealed that Crowley brought back Samuel so that they could help him find Purgatory, the afterlife of monsters, and that Samuel has been working for him. Crowley then states that if Sam and Dean help him he will return Sam's soul, but if they do not help him he will send Sam back to Hell.[51][52] Although Sam still retains his memories, likes, dislikes, and is capable of making rational decisions, he is completely without emotion and appears almost inhuman.[50][52]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He completed both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa's Tommy Ward.[4] Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two years apart, between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994.[3] Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career.[3] During the match in which he took his hat-trick, Griffin was repeatedly called for throwing by the umpires and never bowled again in a Test match.[5] Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat-trick on his birthday,[6] and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.[7]",NONE,leg spinner Jimmy Matthews,,,,,,,,,,,,

The declaration was due to be signed by all 37 members of Moetzet HaAm. However, twelve members could not attend, eleven of them trapped in besieged Jerusalem and one abroad. The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign, leaving spaces for those absent. Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner, Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column, leading to speculation that Vilner's name had been left alone to isolate him, or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration.[15] However, Warhaftig later denied this, stating that a space had been left for him (as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically, but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father's memory and so moved down two spaces. He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories, and remained close for the rest of their lives.

If the reaction is performed in DMF in the presence of LiI or NaI, the product is almost exclusively the Z-isomer.[17] If the E-isomer is the desired product, the Schlosser modification may be used.

At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10, 2017, Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture.[3]

Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to ""No taxation without representation"", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.",NONE,"because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to ""No taxation without representation"", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented",,,,,,,,,,,,

These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a 'hydrophobic pocket' (the S1 position) of the enzyme. It is activated in the presence of trypsin. The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P1 sidechain and the enzyme S1 binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme.[3][4] Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in peptides at slower rates, particularly those containing leucine and methionine at the P1 position.",NONE,"where the side-chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P1 position) is a large hydrophobic amino acid (tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine)",,,,,,,,,,,,

Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid.[2] It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes.

About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich, where they confronted the police, which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers.[1] Hitler was not wounded during the clash, although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter who, when he was shot and killed, pulled Hitler to the pavement with him.

On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, ""The Ides of March are come"", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied ""Aye, Caesar; but not gone.""[19] This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to ""beware the Ides of March.""[20][21] The Roman biographer Suetonius[22] identifies the ""seer"" as a haruspex named Spurinna.",NONE,a haruspex named Spurinna,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Total Drama Island""

July 8, 2007 (2007-07-08)


Total Drama Island is the first season of the series. It first premiered on Canada on July 8, 2007 and June 5, 2008 on the United States. This season takes place at Camp Wawanakwa, a fictional island located somewhere in Muskoka, Ontario where the season is based on a summer camp theme (although a contestant is eliminated at the end of every episode). Like the whole series, this season is a competition to see which of the twenty-two contestants will survive and last the longest. This is because the contestants are brutally tortured along the way through the intense challenges they are given. Challenges are sometimes based on other reality shows like Fear Factor and Survivor. All of this is so that the winner of the season (the one to last the longest on the island and not get eliminated), will win a small fortune of C$100,000 and cheesy fame. Eliminated contestants are sent packing toward the Dock of Shame and must ride the Boat of Losers off the island.

January 11, 2009 (2009-01-11)


Total Drama Action is the second season of the series. It premiered on Canada on January 11, 2009 and June 10 in the U.S. It is a sequel to the first season of the series, Total Drama Island. In this season, fourteen characters from previous returned: Beth, Bridgette, DJ, Duncan, Geoff, Gwen, Harold, Heather, Izzy, Justin, Leshawna, Lindsay, Owen, and Trent. Courtney returns later on in the season due to a lawsuit. In this season, the contestants are taken to a brand new location: an old film lot in the center of Toronto, Ontario. The challenges are now based on movie genres, and the grand prize is now C$1,000,000. Cody, Eva, Ezekiel, Noah, Katie, Sadie, and Tyler do not return to compete, but still appeared for the aftermath special, an extra show which was hosted by Bridgette and Geoff, the first two eliminated contestants. All losers must take the Walk of Shame on the red carpet and ride the Lame-o-sine.

June 10, 2010 (2010-06-10)


Total Drama World Tour is the third season of the series. It premiered in 2010 internationally and continued onto 2011 in Canada. In this season, seventeen contestants are taken on a trip around the world as they compete in cultural themed challenges based on the countries or regions that they visit. An added twist in this season is that the contestants are required to break spontaneously into song, or else be immediately eliminated by Chris (although this rule was not strongly enforced, and no one was eliminated for not singing anyway). Fifteen of the original characters from previous returned: Bridgette, Cody, Courtney, DJ, Duncan, Ezekiel, Gwen, Harold, Heather, Izzy, Leshawna, Lindsay, Noah, Owen, and Tyler. Two new characters, Alejandro and Sierra, also joined the cast at the beginning of this season. Additionally, a third new character, Blaineley, was brought on to compete past the halfway point of the season. Beth, Eva, Geoff, Justin, Katie, Sadie, and Trent did not return to compete, but have instead appeared for the aftermath specials. The prize for this season is also C$1,000,000. People are eliminated by jumping off the Drop of Shame.

January 5, 2012 (2012-01-05)


Total Drama: Revenge of the Island is the fourth season of the series. The series' extension was commissioned by Teletoon from the producers, Fresh TV Inc.[25] It premiered in Canada on January 5, 2012 and in the United States on June 5, 2012. This season returns to Camp Wawanakwa (the original setting of the first season), but no contestants from previous seasons return. Instead, a new set of thirteen contestants compete, which are Anne Maria, B, Brick, Cameron, Dakota, Dawn, Jo, Lightning, Mike, Sam, Scott, Staci, and Zoey.[26] However, some characters from the original cast still have cameo appearances throughout the season.[27] Also, due to the island being abandoned for the past two seasons, Chris had lent the island to a biohazardous waste dump company, causing the island to turn radioactive.[28] This means that causes of radiation and toxic waste is the main theme for this season. This season only contains 13 episodes (half the length of a regular season),[29] and the cash prize is once again C$1,000,000. People are eliminated off the island by the Hurl of Shame.

January 9, 2014 (2014-01-09)[8][21]


Total Drama All-Stars and Total Drama: Pahkitew Island both make up the fifth and most recent season of the Total Drama series which were ordered by Cartoon Network in October 2012 as 26 episodes.[30] Both parts of Season 5 feature different islands and casts, but share similar elements and are both under the same production code.

Total Drama All-Stars is the first part of the fifth and most recent season of the series.[31] While the season premiered on January 9, 2014 in Canada[21] and on September 10, 2013 in the United States.[22] This segment is 13 episodes long, just like the previous season.[32] Total Drama All-Stars features the fourteen most popular contestants from the previous two seasons,[30][33] which are: Alejandro, Cameron, Courtney, Duncan, Gwen, Heather, Jo, Lightning, Lindsay, Mike, Sam, Scott, Sierra, and Zoey.[34] They all compete in several ""Heroes vs. Villains"" themed challenges, which means that the protagonists (heroes) team up and compete against the antagonists (villains).[35] People will now be eliminated by taking the Flush of Shame and the winner once again takes home C$1,000,000.

Total Drama: Pahkitew Island is the second part of the fifth and most recent season and was announced on June 11, 2013.[8] It also consists of 13 episodes and takes place at a new location, this time on an island called Pahkitew Island located somewhere in Western Canada.[8] A new set of fourteen contestants compete in this season, which are: Amy, Beardo, Dave, Ella, Jasmine, Leonard, Max, Rodney, Samey, Scarlett, Shawn, Sky, Sugar, and Topher. The last part of this season first aired in the United States on July 7, 2014 and later in Canada on September 4, 2014.[7][23] Eliminations now take place via the Cannon of Shame and features another one million dollar grand prize. Pahkitew Island features various similar elements to Camp Wawanakwa but the island is much bigger and mostly artificial.

The tallest building in Las Vegas is The Drew Las Vegas, which rises 735 feet (224 m) and was topped out in November 2008.

On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the 'discovery' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador.

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord.[1] The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body.[2] Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the blood–brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), along with the retina. The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon.[3] Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS.[4] The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states: sympathetic and parasympathetic.",NONE,"to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body",,,,,,,,,,,,

528,Rock music,a type of basic rock popular in the 1980s,"By the late 1960s ""classic rock""[1] period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, raga rock, and jazz-rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and synth-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s.",NONE,alternative rock,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal, began organizing ""Banners"", military-social units that included Jurchen, Han Chinese, and Mongol elements. Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity, which he renamed as the Manchus. By 1636, his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty, the Qing. In 1644, peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital, Beijing. Rather than serve them, Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels and seized the capital. Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661â€“1722). The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia. The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways, and while their title was Emperor, they used ""Bogd khaan"" to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus. They also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in dealing with neighboring territories.",NONE,Manchuria,,,,,,,,,,,,

537,IEEE 802.11,what is wifi b/g/n,"802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4 GHz ISM band, operating in the United States under Part 15 of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b and g equipment may occasionally suffer interference from microwave ovens, cordless telephones, and Bluetooth devices. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling methods, respectively. 802.11a uses the 5 GHz U-NII band, which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping channels rather than the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band offering only three non-overlapping channels, where other adjacent channels overlap—see list of WLAN channels. Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies (channels) may be realized, depending on the environment. 802.11n can use either the 2.4 GHz or the 5 GHz band; 802.11ac uses only the 5 GHz band.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
538,The Catcher in the Rye,what does the end of catcher in the rye mean,"Bruce Brooks held that Holden's attitude remains unchanged at story's end, implying no maturation, thus differentiating the novel from young adult fiction.[16] In contrast, Louis Menand thought that teachers assign the novel because of the optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that ""alienation is just a phase.""[17] While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden's state, in between adolescence and adulthood.[18][19] Holden is quick to become emotional. ""I felt sorry as hell for..."" is a phrase he often uses. It is often said that Holden changes at the end, when he watches Phoebe on the carousel, and he talks about the golden ring and how it's good for kids to try and grab it.[18]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States drafted the work and all the Allies of World War II later confirmed it. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war â€“ no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people, self-determination; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations.

542,Scythe,what is the name of the weapon the grim reaper carries,"The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities of Sir William Smith claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the falx foenaria as opposed to the sickle, the falx messoria, was used by the ancient Romans.According to ancient Greek mythology it was believed that Gaea the Greek goddess mother of Titans gave 'a sickle was made out of the strongest metal' to her youngest son 'Kronos' who is also youngest of Titans (also known as God of Harvest) to seek vengeance against her Husband Ouranos for Torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and ""Flesh of The Gods"" (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, NY, 1974.); the ancient Scythians grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.",NONE,scythe,,,,,,,,,,,,

544,Location shooting,where do actors stay when filming on location,"Location shooting often takes place close to the studio; in Hollywood films, this region is delineated in union agreements and is known as the studio zone. Many location shoots, however, are far from the home studio, sometimes on the other side of the world. In these instances, location shooting can provide significant economic development benefits to the area in which they are shot. Cast and crew heavily rely upon local facilities such as catering, transportation, and accommodations. A film that becomes a blockbuster hit can introduce movie audiences around the world to a visually breathtaking location that they were previously unaware of, as the Lord of the Rings trilogy did for New Zealand. This can boost tourism for years or even decades.

586,Cone cell,where are the cones in the eye located,"Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3Â mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula.[1] The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935.[2] Oyster's textbook (1999)[3] cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.[4]",NONE,in the retina,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the central nervous system, the three outer membranes (the meninges) that envelop the brain and spinal cord are composed of connective tissue. They support and protect the body.

It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes – sometimes very sophisticated – are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the ""information"" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with Leopold I signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31.[16] However, for some in Poland prima aprilis ends at noon of April 1st, and prima aprilis jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.",NONE,April 1st,,,,,,,,,,,,

604,Sun,what stage of the star life cycle is the sun in,"The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star.[133] The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the inverse-square law. This stronger force increases the pressure on the core, which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years.[134] At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.[135]",NONE,about halfway through its main-sequence stage,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life - a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty. Atticus plans to appeal the verdict, but before he can do so, Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held.

Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2Â km2), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral.

While exploring Ms. Cooper's dead rose garden with her young neighbour, Kristi, they find a buried box labelled ""Anna Maria"" carved on the top of the box. They open the it and find an antique doll with an apology note written by someone named ""Carrie"". The two girls later notice a peculiar white cat (Snowball) that casts no shadow. Kristi claims he only meows in summer and at night Ashley hears a child crying. One night, Ashley follows the cat by herself and travels back in time to find a young girl, Louisa, dying from consumption. She reveals that her parents had already succumbed to the illness, leaving her an orphan and in the care of her aunt Viola. In the house Ms.Cooper lives in, a young girl (Carrie) looks at Ashley and Louisa through a window in the room Ashley now rents. Ashley soon comes back with Kristi and introduces her to the girl. Ashley then realizes Ms. Cooper is ""Carrie""; the same girl that stole and buried the doll years ago. Kristi and Ashley convince Ms. Cooper to come with them and give the doll back. As soon as they reach the other side Ms Cooper is no longer her older self and regresses to the same age as Ashley and Louisa. Ms.Cooper says that her father would never let her have a doll, so she borrowed Ann Maria. However, Louisa died shortly after, making it impossible for her to return it to its rightful owner. They find a sick Louisa in bed and then leave after giving the doll back. Ms.Cooper is now relieved and happy that Louisa died her friend, but also remorseful that they could not save Louisa from her death. After returning to the present, they go to the cemetery hoping they made Louisa so happy she didn't die They find the girl's grave where Ashley cries herself. Ms. Cooper comes and lays roses on her grave and they leave. Together they leave and think of what could have happened.

The last chapter of the book involves Ashley and her mother talking about her own father's death by cancer, ending with her and her mother realizing they had both felt angry towards him for leaving them, yet also saddened by the fact that he had passed on.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contrary to a popular misconception, the cello did not evolve from the viola da gamba, but existed alongside it for about two and a half centuries. The violin family is also known as the viola da braccio (meaning viola of the arm) family, a reference to the primary way the members of the family are held. This is to distinguish it from the viola da gamba (meaning viola of the leg) family, in which all the members are all held with the legs.

The club had a dominant 2017 season, winning their opening six games and never falling below second place for the entire season. Adelaide claimed their second McClelland Trophy as minor premiers.[30] The Adelaide Crows entered the 2017 finals series as favourites for the premiership; they defeated Greater Western Sydney and Geelong by 36 and 61 points respectively to qualify for the Grand Final, their first since 1998, where they faced Richmond.

728,Gastrocnemius muscle,what is the scientific name for the calf muscle,"Deep to the gastrocnemius (farther from the skin) is the soleus muscle. Some anatomists consider both to be a single muscle, the triceps surae or ""three-headed [muscle] of the calf"", since they share a common insertion via the Achilles tendon. The plantaris muscle and a portion of its tendon run between the two muscles, which is involved in ""locking"" the knee from the standing position. Since the anterior compartment of the leg is lateral to the tibia, the bulge of muscle medial to the tibia on the anterior side is actually the posterior compartment. The soleus is superficial to the mid-shaft of the tibia.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

733,List of Akame ga Kill! characters,who dies in akame ga kill night raid,"Tatsumi (タツミ) is a swordsman who sets out to the capital city to raise money for his impoverished village. He has brown hair and green eyes.[5] Separated from his two companions, Tatsumi is swindled of his money, but is taken in by a girl with a wealthy upbringing.[ch. 1] When he tries to defend that girl from Night Raid, he soon discovers that the girl had actually tortured and killed his comrades, so he kills her and is recruited to join Night Raid,[ch. 1] He accepts, as their actions of fighting corruption would eventually help his village.[ch. 2] His primary weapon is a short sword, but he later inherits Bulat's Teigu ""Demon Armor: Incursio"" (悪鬼纏身 インクルシオ, Akki Tenshin: Inkurushio), which was created from the still living flesh of an adaptive dragon Danger Beast called Tyrant. While normally a short sword, Incuriso can form armor around the user and grant them powers such as invisibility and superhuman strength.[ch. 5,14] However, Tatsumi's continued use of Incursio takes a toll on his body, and his body and his humanity are consumed by Tyrant. In the manga, he transforms into Tyrant but retains his mind,[ch. 76-77] but in the anime he dies after defeating Shikoutazer.Ep. 24 In the manga, after the war, Tatsumi, trapped in his Tryrant form for life, returns to Mine's side, and they settle in his old village to raise the child they conceived before she fell into coma.[ch. 78]",NONE,Tatsumi,,,,,,,,,,,,
734,Biltmore Estate,when was the biltmore house opened to the public,"In an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism.[8] Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.[9]",NONE,March 1930,,,,,,,,,,,,
735,Dodgers–Yankees rivalry,when was the last time the dodgers played yankees in the world series,"The Dodgersâ€“Yankees rivalry is a Major League Baseball (MLB) rivalry between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees. The Dodgers are a member club of the National League (NL) West division, and the Yankees are a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The rivalry between the Dodgers and Yankees is one of the most well-known rivalries in Major League Baseball.[1] The two teams have met 11 times in the World Series, more times than any other pair of teams from the American and National Leagues.[1] The initial significance was embodied in the two teams' proximity in New York City, when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States, and since the 1980s, the two largest cities in the United States. The Dodgers currently lead the regular season series 7-6. Although the rivalry's significance arose from the two teams' numerous World Series meetings,[1] the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981.[1] They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a 3-game interleague series.[2] Nevertheless, games between the two teams have become quite popular and draw sellout crowds.[3]",NONE,1981,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caribou starts searching for his treasure that he stole from the royal family after realizing it was taken after waking up from getting beat by Luffy. Jimbei and Neptune talk about how Jimbei might join the Straw Hats and putting a new pirate flag in Fishman Island which is the Straw Hat Pirate flag. Later, the Minister of the Right tells King Neptune that the Tamate Box is gone and it might explode in the hands of Luffy if he opens it. However, when Luffy returns, he announces that he gave all the treasure that he recovered to Pekoms and Baron Tamago, along with the tamate box, and tells everyone that he talked back to Big Mom. While Neptune and the Minister of the Right worry about the fate of the Straw Hats, and Nami beats Luffy up for giving away the treasure, Jimbei decides to cut off the alliance with Big Mom before things get ugly. Caribou finds Tamago and Pekoms with his treasure that he stole and attacks Pekoms with his Gatling Gun. Pekoms reveals himself to be a Zoan-type Devil Fruit user. Caribou then attempts to slice off Pekom's head, saying that he was stronger because he was a logia-type devil fruit eater, only to get punched in the stomach by Pekoms, rendering him unconscious again. Pekoms and Tamago then leave Fishman island. It is later revealed that Smoker and Tashigi were reassigned to the G-5 Marine Branch, the most ruthless marine branch that don't even take orders from the HQ, and arrested a bunch of pirates emerging from Fishman Island, who tell Smoker that Luffy beat Hordy, with Smoker replying that he already knows and calls them idiots.

""Finally Time to Go! Goodbye, Fish-Man Island!""
""Tsui ni Shukkō! Sayonara Gyojin-tō"" (ついに出航! さよなら魚人島) 
November 18, 2012


The mermaids and Keimi from the Mermaid Cafe ask Sharley if they can say farewell to the Straw Hats. Sharley says that her prediction that Luffy will destroy Fishman Island might not happen after all since they defeated Hordy and the New Fishman Pirates. However, Keimi fears that Madam Sharley still believes that Luffy will destroy the Fishman Island because she knows that her predictions are always right. Shirahoshi meanwhile is crying and asking the Straw Hats to not go. While Minister of the Right talks to Neptune about mentioning the exploding tamate box to the Straw Hats, Neptune points out that Usopp, Brook, and Chopper complain that they are going to die in the New World and that they shouldn't tell them more bad news, later having optimistic ideas about how Big Mom might not open it herself or that the explosives might not explode. The Minister of the Left gives Nami a new Log Pose with three needles so they can get to the islands in the New World. He explains that the new log pose takes in the magnetic waves of 3 surrounding islands and that the needle that moves the most is the direction of the most dangerous island. After hearing that, Nami, Chopper, and Usopp tell the Minister of the left to keep it down so Luffy doesn't hear, which he evidently does. He then grabs onto Nami wanting to see the new Log Pose and says to go in the direction of the needle that moves the most, stating, ""that's where the party is"". Nami insists that she will tell the crew where to go. However, Luffy states that he should decide where they should go, as he is the captain. Franky gets a new haircut and they start to leave but Shirahoshi comes and ask them to pinky promise to come back and they did. The Straw Hats and the fishmen go their separate ways and Luffy remembers the times when Shanks, Rayleigh, Jimbei, and Ace told him something important. The Straw Hats then comment about what they will do once they are in the New World.

""To the New World! Heading for the Ultimate Sea!""
""Shin Sekai e! Saikyō no Umi o Mezashite"" (新世界へ! 最強の海をめざして) 
November 25, 2012


The Straw Hats are heading to the New World. Nami is taking a bath in the Thousand Sunny and Chopper comes in. Nami asks Chopper if he wants to join her in the bath and he says no claiming that he took one two days ago and the cloud reminds him of cotton candy. Sanji and Brook walk by and saw Nami taking a bath so they stare at her. Nami asked Chopper to move aside away from the cloud she made and the cloud electrified Sanji and Brook. Chopper claims he is scared and he won't eat the cloud. Meanwhile Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Franky and Robin are hanging out. Luffy tells Usopp to hurry up with the fish hook because he wants to catch and eat a big fish. Robin says that Luffy and Usopp are having fun. Franky says he wants Cola with a big fish. Zoro says he wants to have a drink to celebrate entering the New World. Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp sees three big fish. Zoro wants to eat a fried fish with salt. Usopp wants a fish sliced up and grilled. Luffy wants a fish with mayonnaise. Usopp says which fish Luffy wants and claims that it is not edible. Luffy punches the fish with gear second and Usopp uses the fish hook to grab hold of it. The fish that they caught suddenly got ate by a bigger fish and Zoro uses 360 pound cannon killing it. Nami is still in the bath and she claims that the rest of the crew are making too much of a ruckus and that she shouldn't have trusted them in watching the ship for her. They suddenly got caught in a White Storm and Luffy claims it is the wormhole of his dreams and Usopp slaps him for saying that. Nami claims the crew to be stupid for getting into too much trouble while she was taking a bath. They get caught in the White Storm and they try to hang out to something so they won't fly out of the ship. They finally crash into a whale without noticing at first. Brook then claims that the whale is Laboon but they finally see a whole bunch of whales and the others claim that Laboon is not here but in the first half of the grand line. Sanji then says that they need to get out of there and asks Nami about what they should do. Nami says they don't need to do anything and Sanji listened. The Straw Hats asked one of the whales to give them a ride to the surface of the New World. Brook sang a song for the whales so they can bring them to the surface. Before they got to the surface the Straw Hats remembered the times during their training to become stronger so they can regroup and head towards the New World. They finally surfaced and Thousand Sunny hopped off the whales and landed onto the ocean. The Straw Hats say goodbye to the whales and they see some ships claiming they are pirate ships but then they saw that the ships belong to the Marines.

December 2, 2012


There is a whole fleet of Neo Marine ships, one of which houses Ain and Bins. The Straw Hats fight back against a fleet of Marine ships, but it turns out to be a mirage. Huge raindrops appear out of nowhere, and the water suddenly splits. The Straw Hats wake up with different clothes. However, Sanji sees that the food he cooked is gone, so he blames it on Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper until Chopper wonders if the sea is haunted. Suddenly, the food begins to be eaten very quickly. Luffy finds the person who ate the food and it turns out to be a little girl. She attacks the Straw Hats and they fight back. It is then revealed that she ate the Mini Mini no Mi and that her name is Lily. She turns out to be a giant, though her devil fruit makes her small. She befriends the Straw Hats after they save her from drowning and wants to see her dad (this is why she invaded the Marine's fleet of ships). She then talks about food to Luffy. On the Neo Marines' ship, Ain calls Shuzo and asks why he was not there. Shuzo tells Ain that he will make a better second-in-command and that he is going after Lily's father. The Straw Hats see Marine ships coming their way who have Lily's father captive. They are heading towards Impel Down, so Luffy declares battle against the Marines.

December 16, 2012


Several of Shuzo's men appear and fight against the Marines and easily begin to overwhelm them. Luffy continues to fight Shuzo while Zoro fights Momonga to which the Vice-admiral states they shouldn't interfere with their business like this. Zoro uses his 360 pound cannon and sends Momonga back that destroys a Marine ship. From the sidelines, Nami notices the wave changes in the ocean and realizes a Thrust-up Stream is coming. When Usopp asks what that is and asks if it's similar to the Knock-up Stream like the one that took them to Sky Island, Nami says it is, but smaller, but still has enough power to destroy a Marine ship. She has Franky fire the anchors to the raft Panz Fry and the others are on and lets Sanji and Lily know in advance. Luffy has a hard time against Shuzo's fighting style due to his long arms, but then starts using Haki to overwhelm Shuzo again. As Robin, Chopper, and Brook make their way back to the Sunny, several Thrust-up Streams take out some ships, one of the streams has Usopp in the Shark Submerge flying back to the ship. As Nami has everyone get on the ship she has Franky use a Coup de Burst after the raft everyone is one get close to the thrust and they fly away. However, Luffy and Zoro fall off due to the raft breaking and Luffy uses his arms to grab the raft while Shuzo uses a knife with a Vivre Card attached to it on the raft. After they get away, Momonga gathers his men on a broken ship and laments them having gotten away again while Shuzo goes to finish the Marines off with an attack and defeats Momonga. He then travels to the Straw Hats location and recalls his past fight with Ain and how their fight lasted for over five hours till she won, prompting their leader Z to give her the win and the title of next in command. Shuzo is determined to become the new next in command and destroy the pirates. The Straw Hats land in a location around some rocks and Robin notes they will be safe for now and Nami happy that the planned worked and that they finally got out of the sea. Chopper works on Panz Fry noting he had some bad injuries and that he'll be fine if he rests. Lily thanks Chopper for helping her father and the rest of the crew. Luffy is excited that he can try Panz Fry's cooking and Lily reveals she took some food from the Marines and while Zoro notes that's odd given the circumstances, he changes his tone after seeing she took some sake also. As Luffy asks Panz Fry to make some food, Sanji kicks him stating he needs to rest and Chopper says Luffy didn't listen. However, Panz Fry says he will cook for then despite Lily's protest stating that as a chef and Giant, he was saved by the crew and would shame himself if he didn't repay them for risking their lives and thanks Luffy for saving him and will cook the food. Shuzo arrives at the location and notes they are out of torpedoes and several of his men offer their lives to use as torpedoes, prompting Shuzo to acknowledge their sacrifice and say they are true men and state he will not let their deaths be for nothing. The ships then prepare to attack the Straw Hats.

Shuzo orders his men to be launched at the island like torpedoes and sacrifice themselves for him. He then attacks Panz Fry and Lily. Luffy faces off against Shuzo but starts to be overpowered by Shuzo and Alpacacino. Lily attempts to go inside Shuzo to explode him by growing to full size, but he senses her intentions using Haki & uses Luffy as a shield so that she ends up inside Luffy instead. Lilly then takes advantage of the situation and turns Luffy into a giant with a combination of her ability and Luffy's rubbery form. Luffy defeats Shuzo and his pet alpaca and the group gets to eat the heavenly food from Panz Fry before parting ways with Lilly & Pans Fry and setting off for another adventure in the New World.

He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had ""been having a little fun pulling the leg of H. G. Wells,"" but then he ""got caught up in the excitement of [his] own ideas.""[10] Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future.

780,Boroughs of New York City,are queens and brooklyn part of long island,"
Brooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island, is the city's most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the largest central core neighborhood in the outer boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country.[16] Marine Park[17] and Prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn. Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms,[18][19] and of postmodern art[20] and design.[19]
Queens (Queens County), on Long Island north and east of Brooklyn, is geographically the largest borough, the most ethnically diverse county in the United States,[21] as well as the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[6][7] Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough has since developed both commercial and residential prominence. Downtown Flushing has become one of the busiest central core neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. Queens is the site of Citi Field, the baseball stadium of the New York Mets, and hosts the annual U.S. Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Additionally, two of the three busiest airports serving the New York metropolitan area, John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, are located in Queens. (The third is Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey.)
The Bronx (Bronx County) is New York City's northernmost borough and the only New York City borough that is part of the United States mainland. It is the location of Yankee Stadium, the baseball stadium of the New York Yankees, and home to the largest cooperatively owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City.[22] It is also home to the Bronx Zoo, the world's largest metropolitan zoo,[23] which covers 265 acres (107 ha) and houses over 6,000 animals.[24] Directly to the zoo's north is the New York Botanical Garden, a botanical garden and National Historic Landmark. Pelham Bay Park is the largest park in New York City, at 2,772 acres (1,122 ha).[17]
Staten Island (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and to Manhattan by way of the Staten Island Ferry, a free commuter ferry and popular tourist attraction which provides unobstructed views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Lower Manhattan. In central Staten Island, the Staten Island Greenbelt spans approximately 2,500 acres (10 km2), including 28 miles (45 km) of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city.[25] Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.

789,Limited government,the main idea of limited government is that,"In political philosophy, limited government is where the government is empowered by law from a starting point of having no power, or where governmental power is restricted by law, usually in a written constitution. It is a key concept in the history of liberalism. The United States Constitution presents an example of the federal government not possessing any power except what is delegated to it by the Constitution - with the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution specifically stating that powers not specifically delegated to the federal government is reserved for the people and the states. The Magna Carta and the United States Constitution also represents important milestones in the limiting of governmental power. The earliest use of the term limited government dates back to King James VI and I in the late 16th century.[1] Limited government put into practice often involves the protection of individual liberty from government intrusion.[2]",NONE,"the government is empowered by law from a starting point of having no power, or where governmental power is restricted by law, usually in a written constitution",,,,,,,,,,,,
790,Sweet Caroline,when did sweet caroline start at red sox games,"The song has been played at Fenway Park, home of Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox, since at least 1997,[20] and in the middle of the eighth inning at every game since 2002.[21] On opening night of the 2010 season at Fenway Park, the song was performed by Diamond himself. ""Sweet Caroline"" was played at Penn State Nittany Lions football games at Beaver Stadium until August 2012, halting after the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.[22][23] Performances at Beaver Stadium resumed in September 2013, however.[24] The song is played at the start of the fourth quarter of Pittsburgh Panthers Football games at Heinz Field.[25] In response, West Virginia University students and fans will yell ""eat shit, Pitt"" during the refrain if heard played.[26] It is also an unofficial song of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, being played at athletic events and pep rallies.",NONE,at least 1997,,,,,,,,,,,,

793,Epistle to the Philippians,who was the book of philippians written to,"The letter was written to the church at Philippi, one of the earliest churches to be founded in Europe. They were very attached to Paul, just as he was very fond of them. Of all the churches, their contributions (which Paul gratefully acknowledges) are among the only ones he accepts. (Acts 20:33–35; 2 Cor. 11:7–12; 2 Thess. 3:8). The generosity of the Philippians comes out very conspicuously (Phil. 4:15). ""This was a characteristic of the Macedonian missions, as 2 Cor. 8 and 9 amply and beautifully prove. It is remarkable that the Macedonian converts were, as a class, very poor (2 Cor. 8:2), though the very first converts were of all classes (Acts 16); and the parallel facts, their poverty and their open-handed support of the great missionary and his work, are deeply harmonious.""

798,Habib,what is the meaning of the name habib,"Habib (Arabic: حبيب‎, translit. ḥabīb; Arabic pronunciation: [ħabiːb ]), sometimes written as Habeeb, is an Arabic masculine given name and occasional surname with the meaning ""beloved"".[1] The name is popular throughout the Muslim World, though particularly in the Middle East and Africa. In other countries, especially in Yemen and Southeast Asian countries such as Brunei, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, it is an honorific to address a Muslim scholar of Sayyid (a descendant of Muhammad) families. It is important to note that the name, as is the case with other Arabic names, is not confined to Muslims. Notable examples of Christian individuals named Habib include 'Habib the Deacon'[2] and Gabriel Habib[3] and the Philosopher Habib.[4]",NONE,beloved,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ceremony was televised in the United States by American Broadcasting Company (ABC), produced by Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd and directed by Glenn Weiss.[5] Comedian Jimmy Kimmel hosted for the second consecutive year, making him the first person to host back-to-back ceremonies since Billy Crystal in 1997 and 1998.[6]",NONE,"Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California",,,,,,,,,,,,

She accuses him of killing his parents, and he says his mother killed herself after his father cheated on her, so he caused the accident which killed his father and his mistress. Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has tied up Garrett and Kevin, threatening to kill them unless Claire stays with him. A violent altercation occurs as Claire attempts to free them. Noah pours kerosene around the barn, causing it to ignite in flames. Garrett frees himself and attempts to choke Noah with a rope, prompting Noah to shoot him in the chest. Claire stabs Noah's eye with Kevin's EpiPen. Noah removes the EpiPen from his eye and blindly attempts to strangle Claire to death. When he holds Kevin at gunpoint, she pulls a lever that drops an engine on Noah, killing him. Claire and Kevin then help a wounded Garrett exit the burning barn house as police and paramedics arrive.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

810,List of Game of Thrones characters,who plays the dragon queen from game of thrones,"Daenerys Targaryen (season 1â€“present) portrayed by Emilia Clarke. Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty. Also called ""the Stormborn"", she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert's Rebellion. For seventeen years, she has been under the care of Viserys, whom she fears, as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him. In exchange for an army, Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo, making her a Khaleesi, a queen of the Dothraki. Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language, she manages to get past their barriers. She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man. After embracing the Dothraki culture, she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother. She later becomes pregnant with Drogo's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the ""Stallion Who Mounts the World"". After her brother's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon, Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son. However, during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman. Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic. Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo, leaving him in a permanent catatonic state, and forcing Daenerys to end her husband's life. Losing both her husband and son, Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake. She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo's body, then steps into the burning funeral pyre. After the fire extinguishes itself, the Khaleesi and three baby dragons, named Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion, are found alive and unharmed. Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne. She becomes the first female Dothraki leader. In Season 2, she is lost in the Red Waste, a stretch of barren land. She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth, where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros. When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree, she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them, killing Pyat Pree. In the second season's finale, she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree. Her horde loot Xaro's mansion to buy a ship. Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor, a city in Slaver's Bay, where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied. She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy, and accepts him into her queensguard. On her departure from the city, she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders. By the end of Season 3, although her power has not yet been tested, she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai, her remaining Dothraki brethren (and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki, who advise her) 2,000 'Second Sons' cavalrymen, 8,000 'Unsullied' elite infantry, and three rapidly growing dragons. The stay in Slaver's Bay has made her question her motives, however, and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well, donning the honorific ""Breaker of Chains"" as the slaves hold her to the sky, praising her as their Mhysa, or ""Mother"". Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen, the last of the slave cities in Slaver's Bay, but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons, especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food. Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet, Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being. She eventually learns of Jorah's original purpose, which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon, and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution. After she receives too many complaints about her dragons, Daenerys, locks Rhaegal and Viserion of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon. Meanwhile, Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy, a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied. She considers freeing her dragons, but they attempt to attack her, making her realize that they are no longer loyal to her. After Daario and Grey Worm arrest a member of the Sons of the Harpy, Mossador implores Daenerys to execute their captive, but Barristan tells her of the Mad King's actions against his enemies, which included burning them with wildfire while laughing. He asks her not to execute the captive without a fair trial, and she agrees with him. Mossador goes against her wishes, and kills the captive Son of the Harpy. Daenerys has him publicly executed, which leads a riot to break out between the old masters and the freed slaves. At night, Daenerys finds that Drogon has returned, but when she tries to touch his face, he flies away. Soon afterward, a group of Unsullied patrolling the streets of Meereen are stopped by a crying woman who points them to an alleyway. The Unsullied head in to investigate, but it is revealed that the entire affair was a set up after they are soon cornered by a group of the Sons of the Harpy. The Unsullied attempt to fight back, but the Sons of the Harpy kill many of them. Barristan Selmy sees the commotion and tries to help, killing many of the Sons of the Harpy, but gets badly wounded, and dies. Grey Worm also sustains serious but nonfatal injuries. Daenerys is furious after learning what has happened to Barristan, and rounds up the leaders of the great Meereenese houses. She takes them into the catacombs where she randomly has one of them shoved forward. The Meereenese lord is promptly killed by dragonfire from Rhaegal, and he and Viserion eat him. Daenerys then has all the lords arrested, including her former adviser Hizdahr zo Loraq, whom she decides to marry to win over the Meereenese nobles. To respect the culture of the region, she agrees to have the fighting pits reinstated (she had previously declined due to her distaste for killing for sport). Hizdahr convinces Daenerys to go to one of the pits to see the contestants battling over who will go to the final competition. Daenerys is sickened by the bloodshed, and gets up to leave, but her attention is turned by one masked competitor who defeats all of the other competitors without killing any of them. This competitor turns out to be Jorah Mormont, who is trying to win over Daenerys' favor after being banished. Daenerys orders the Unsullied to take him away, but Jorah announces that he has brought her a gift, and Tyrion Lannister reveals himself to Daenerys. After a round of questioning, Daenerys banishes Jorah once again, but takes Tyrion on as her adviser. On the great opening of Daznak's Pit, Jorah resurfaces as a voluntary contender on the arena, but Daenerys refuses to stop the games to spare his life. Jorah eventually prevails and saves her life by impaling with his spear an attacker from the Sons of the Harpy, who appear in legions and attack Daenerys' guards. Cornered at the midst of the arena, defeat seems immediate when Drogon returns, killing many Sons of the Harpy despite being wounded by several of their spears. Daenerys manages to rekindle their bond and climbs his back, riding off into the distance to a stunned crowd. She roams the Great Steppe north of the city, where Drogon seems reluctant to obey her commands or even hunt for food. Strolling about on her own, Daenerys is faced with an incoming Dothraki khalasar of great numbers, and after dropping a ring to the ground to leave a trail, she is surrounded. In season 6, the Dothraki take her to Vaes Dothrak, where she identifies herself to Khal Moro as Drogo's former wife. Out of respect for Dothraki traditions, they take Daenerys to join the Dosh Khaleen, which consisted of the wives of deceased khals. Daenerys refuses and instead burns the temple down with herself and all the khals still inside. She emerges unscathed, and the awed Dothraki accept her as their new leader. She returns to Meereen with her new army and destroys the slaver fleet assaulting the city with her dragons. In the aftermath, Daenerys meets with Theon and Yara Greyjoy, who offer their support for her claim so that they can overthrow their uncle Euron. Daenerys accepts their aid and secures help from the Reach and Dorne, names Tyrion as her hand, but breaks up with Daario, ordering him to stay behind and govern Slaver's Bay in her absence. With her new army, Daenerys finally sets sail for Westeros. In Season 7 Daenerys finally uses her dragons in battle, annihilating a Lannister force and their baggage train with fire. Daenerys welcomes Jon Snow to Dragonstone, seeing him as a friend and ally, insisting that he bend the knee to her but exhibiting patience with his refusal. She believes his tales of white walkers and agrees to let him mine dragonglass (obsidian) from her land. When Jon's expedition north of the Wall gets into trouble Daenerys takes her dragons to rescue them, and is devastated when the Night King kills one. On the ship back to Dragonstone she and Jon make love.",NONE,Emilia Clarke,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sarada wonders how Sasuke would be as a father since she was very young when he left the village and has not seen him much since. She asks Sakura if Sasuke needed glasses when he was a child, and Sakura's vague answer does little to satisfy Sarada. Sarada decides to look into the Uchiha clan, learning about the Sharingan and how she and her father are the clan's last living members; when she tries to do further research in regard to her father, she discovers that the information is restricted from public access. Sarada approaches her mother again and asks her if she even is Sasuke's wife. Out of anger, Sakura breaks the ground with a punch, but then she apologizes to Sarada for raising her voice and reassures her that Sasuke's feelings are connected with hers.

In an effort to find their family portrait amid the ruins of the house, Sarada discovers that Sasuke's picture is that of a larger one featuring Karin, Suigetsu, and Jugo.

Meanwhile, Shizune gets to know from Sakura that Sarada has awakened her Sharingan a long time ago. Sakura informs Shizune that she does not want Sarada to find out her father was an enemy of Konoha in the past, this being the reason why she did not tell her about the others in the photo with team Taka. Sarada complains to Sasuke that he has never been around and that her mother never tells her anything. Sarada asks Sasuke about the woman in the picture (Karin) and his reason for abandoning his family for so long, but he replies simply that she has nothing to do with it. After hearing his answer, she cries out and leaves the tower, and Naruto asks Sasuke if it would not be better to let her know about the reason behind his absence. Both reminisce about the time when Sasuke left Konoha in order to stay vigilant in case a threat similar to Kaguya came, as such a menace would bring global harm. Back then, Sasuke decided to keep his mission a secret, even at the cost of his daughter's possible future resentment. Naruto then leaves the tower and tries to comfort Sarada. Later, a mysterious person talks to Shin about his plan to revive Akatsuki and prepares to attack everyone at the tower along with several people who look like Shin. That person uses blades to attack Naruto, who foils the attack using Kurama's chakra. Then, Sasuke joins the fight and tries to defeat the enemy using Fire Style. The enemy uses Shin as a shield. He then introduces himself as Shin Uchiha and tells everyone present about his plan to revive Akatsuki using Sasuke's Sharingan. Sasuke asks Naruto to protect Sarada and decides to fight Shin alone. As Sasuke is about to attack him, Sasuke's sword suddenly pierces Naruto, as Shin explains that this is his Dōjutsu (Visual Prowess). Accordingly, Sasuke realizes that Shin marked his sword in their fight earlier. Because of Naruto's injury, Kurama's chakra fades, and Shin attacks Sarada with his blades, but Sasuke comes in their way to protect her, injuring himself in the process. Shin stops Sasuke's movements through the blades piercing Sasuke's body. Shin moves to take Sasuke's Sharingan, but Sakura suddenly appears and defeats the enemy with a single punch. Sarada stands surprised at former Team 7's resilience and power, realizing that even Naruto's injury has already started healing. Sakura hugs Sarada and apologizes to Sasuke for not making things more clear to their daughter, but Sasuke tells her that it is his fault. Naruto grabs both older and younger Shin and drags them toward himself. As they are about to get near Naruto, Shin's mysterious creature begins teleporting Shin and Sarada to his place, but Sakura pushes her daughter out of the way and is teleported instead of her. Sakura then ends up in Shin's hideout and finds herself surrounded by more of his sons.

""Connected Feelings""
""Tsunagaru Omoi"" (つながる想い) 
August 30, 2017


In order to find Sakura, Sasuke and Naruto decide to go to Orochimaru's hideout to ask for information regarding Shin's location. Naruto tells Sarada that there is a chance she will meet the people in the picture there. Meanwhile, in his hideout, Shin explains to Sakura that human beings are bounded by their genes and are simple vessels. He also mentions how Akatsuki enables the stronger genes to thrive through battles and helps the formation of new Jutsu. On their way to Orochimaru's hideout, Naruto and Sasuke meet Captain Yamoto, who is on surveillance over Orchimaru. After getting into the hideout, they meet Sasuke's former teammates - Suigetsu and Jugo, who are the current caretakers of the hideout. Then, Orochimaru appears and meets them with a new, younger appearance. After hearing Shin's name from Sasuke, he takes them to another chamber and explains that Shin Uchiha is one of his old experiments that was used for the right arm of Danzo. Shin has a unique ability of being transplanted to or injected with anything without any side effects. He also explains why Shin refers to himself as Uchiha, the reason being that he can manifest the Sharingan and is obsessed with the Uchiha name, in particular with Sasuke's brother, Itachi. On their way out, Sarada asks Suigetsu if he knows the lady in the picture, and he identifies her as Karin. After hearing this, Sarada asks if she is in the hideout, to which Suigetsu replies that she is in another one. Then, Sarada reveals her doubts about her parentage, shocking Suigetsu and making him ask himself if her suspicions could ever be possible. In order to take a DNA test, Suigetsu takes a DNA sample from Sarada and uses what he thinks is Karin's umbilical cord. The result shows that there is a perfect match, making Suigetsu assume that Karin is Sarada's mom. Because of this, Sarada feels lied to and fooled by her mother. Realizing how Sarada feels, Suigetsu runs out of the room to prevent further problems. Naruto sees Sarada crying and comes to her. After Sarada manifests the Sharingan, Naruto shows Sarada her eyes in a mirror. He then tells her to calm down and tries to comfort her, but Sarada tells him that he has nothing to do with her and that he cannot understand how she feels. Naruto says he is the Hokage and the entire village is his family, which also includes Sarada. Naruto also tells her that the bonds between a parent and a child are not just based on history and blood relations but on the love between them, and he asks Sarada if she can remember any moments that show the love between her and Sakura. Sarada does this and thinks of several such instances, which depict how Sakura was taking care of Sarada when she was sick, how she reassured her about Sasuke's love for both of them and how she poked her forehead. After remembering all of these moments, Sarada becomes willing to go and save her mother from Shin Uchiha. After both of them leave the room, Suigetsu gets frightened and hides so that Sarada cannot see him. Orochimaru comments that Sakura might be dead already, to which Sasuke replies that his wife is not weak. Sasuke then says that his Visual Prowess is recovered and he will take everyone to the hideout in his Susanoo. Sarada and Chocho are amazed by his abilities. In the hideout of Shin Uchiha, Shin plans to revive Akatsuki by killing Sasuke and taking his Sharingan, as he thinks Sasuke is not worthy of the Uchiha name.

As Naruto and the others are coming to save Sakura, she starts fighting Shin after gaining enough information about his evil intentions of reviving Akatsuki. Meanwhile, Naruto and the others get confronted by Shin's clones upon their arrival at the hideout. Sarada rushes to save Sakura and Sasuke goes after her, while Naruto faces Shin's clones alone. Shin attacks Sakura with his blades and successfully pierces two blades into her arm, restricting Sakura's movement. Afterwards, Shin tries to kill Sakura with a giant shuriken, but Sasuke interrupts him and immediately helps Sakura, much to Sarada's enjoyment. He then goes after Shin, who lost his right leg, but a clone of Shin gets in his way. Instead, Shin stabs Sasuke along with his clone. After Sasuke and Sakura briefly look at each other, Sakura runs to the opposite direction of Shin, who sends his blades after her, but Sasuke changes places with Sakura using his Rinnegan and she finally defeats Shin with a single punch. After that, the clones fighting Naruto come near Shin, but instead of saving him, they stab him with their weapons. They tell him that they are just following Shin's principles, as his Visual Prowess is no longer powerful, and they believe that it is their turn to get to evolve. Then, several other clones made by the clones themselves come and start fighting Naruto and Sasuke. Shin tries to teleport himself along with Sakura between all the commotion, but Sarada stops him by punching his mysterious creature who has just begun teleporting them, thus showing that she inherited Sakura’s natural control over chakra, much to Sasuke's pride and Sakura's surprise. The clone fighting Naruto stops after seeing Kurama inside Naruto, and Naruto promises that they will not attack them if they behave. Sakura hugs Sarada and Sasuke tells Sarada that her existence in the world is the proof of his and Sakura's connected feelings. Afterwards, all the clones are sent to the orphanage that is run by Kabuto, and upon returning to the village, Chocho sees Choji in his slim form for the first time in her life and her quest to find her real father ends. At Orochimaru's hideout, Karin explains to Suigetsu that Sarada really is Sasuke and Sakura's daughter. She scolds Suigetsu for the mistake he made, as she was just the midwife for Sakura when Sakura went into labour, and tells him that the umbilical cord he used for the test is actually the one between Sakura and Sarada. She then urges him to go and apologize to Sarada. Sakura confirms to Sarada along with Sasuke that she is their biological child at the dining table. Next day, Sarada and Sakura see Sasuke off as he leaves for his mission. Before departing, Sasuke pokes Sarada's forehead and, remembering this gesture from her mother, Sarada turns to Sakura and smiles happily. At the academy, Sarada tells Boruto that she wants to become Hokage in the future.

Konohamaru teaches Sarada more about the Sharingan and tells her she is now his rival toward becoming Hokage. During the summit, Naruto reveals that Sasuke has been using his Rinnegan to investigate the other dimensions and fears that one of them may be harboring dangerous threats. While the other Kage express concern that the new generation of ninja are not cut out for taking on threats should they be faced with a new war, Naruto reveals his belief that the new generation will manage to surpass them.

With last week’s fear of war still hanging in the air, Naruto hopes to improve relations with the Land of Water by sending his village’s students on a field trip to their Hidden Village. Principal Iruka concurs, and before they know it the students are on a cruise ship en route to the Hidden Mist. To the surprise of the students the Mist has been completely modernized, perhaps even more so than the Leaf, and seeing their amazement in the midst of a different village and culture is undoubtedly entertaining. In typical anime fashion, the girls are charmed by the foreign boys, while the boys are more interested in games and movies.

Last week’s instructive foray into the Hidden Mist extends into a class visit to the office of the new Mizukage, Chojuro. Boruto quickly tires of Chojuro’s speech about unity between the villages, which the Kage mercifully cuts short. Kagura continues the Kage’s story later, explaining that Chojuro is the reason for the Mist Village’s recent prosperity. Kagura takes some time to reflect on the “Blood Mist’s” dark past, which triggers a rather pertinent outburst from Iwabe. Iwabe tells a story about his grandfather being killed by the Fourth Mizukage, making a point that the Mist should not be so quick to write off their violent history when the war is still fresh in the minds of their victims.

As Buntan begins pressuring Sarada with her array of Lightning Release techniques augmented by the Kiba, Sarada manages to hold her own with her Sharingan. Buntan voices both her excitement and disdain at facing the Sharingan, seeing it as not only an unfair lineage trait but also a shortcut to power. Sarada retorts that Buntan stole the Kiba, but Buntan insists that she earned them and proved to be her father's child by more than just lineage. As the two continue to clash, with Sarada continuously copying her opponent's attacks, the Konoha-nin realizes that their constant lightning attacks are heating the water around them and creating a mist. Sarada lures Buntan into the mist with genjutsu and uses the increased hydrogen to set off a large explosion with her paper bomb. Buntan is defeated, but Sarada collapses in exhaustion from excessive usage of her Sharingan. Meanwhile, Kagura fights Boruto and prepares to strike him down; Chojuro takes down three members of Shizuma's gang and is nearly ambushed before Iwabe arrives to take down the fourth, but the two get caught up in a large explosion.

Heedless of Beerus and Whis' warnings, Goku uses Zenō-sama's button to head to his realm and convince both Zenō-samas to hold the tournament. When he returns to Beerus' planet, Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Zenō-sama's naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse. Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again. Goku, Beerus, and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais, where the Great Priest arrives. He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the ""Tournament of Power"" (力の大会, Chikara no Taikai).

The Great Priest explains the details of the ""Tournament of Power"" and states that it will be held on ""the World of Void"". It is a place of ""infinite nothingness"", where the competitors can fight without limits. The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls, while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence. Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty. Goku suggests asking Zenō-sama to ignore it, but Whis advises against this. Whis tells Goku that Zenō-sama has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous. Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Zenō-sama to hold the tournament in the first place. Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces. The Great Priest also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Zenō-sama's benefit. Each universe is to name three fighters. Goku sets off to recruit teammates. After Vegeta refuses, Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu, who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7. Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan. Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic. Back at Zenō-sama's palace, all the gods from all 12 universes gather. The Great Priest explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match. He alludes to the possibility of Zenō-sama erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament. In the first round, Majin Buu is to fight Basil (バジル, Bajiru), a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9.

Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh (ロウ, Rō), the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Zenō-sama is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Zenō-sama is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Great Priest announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender (ラベンダ, Rabenda) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match. Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender.

As their battle begins, Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan's eyes and blinds him. Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison, but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone. Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he cannot continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie. After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean, the Great Priest announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well. However, Universes 1, 5, 8, and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong. Zeno-sama had long believed that there were too many universes. He was planning to erase most of them anyway, but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared. With the announcement concluded, the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo (ベルガモ, Berugamo), Basil's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine.

Before their battle begins, Bergamo denounces Goku before the assembled gods. Bergamo pleads with Zenō-sama to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased. Zenō-sama agrees on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle. Great Priest states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure, Zenō-sama will immediately erase all of the universes. Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms. When the fight begins, Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed. Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times, but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku's attacks. He grows stronger and physically larger. Goku continues to attack, which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight. Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue, which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha. Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure, but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge. The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin. The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner. Suddenly, a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo (トッポ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle. Goku, who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo, agrees to fight Toppo.

After obtaining Zenō-sama's blessing to proceed, Goku and Toppo begin their battle. Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku's shoulder. Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows, but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug. He begins squeezing the life out of Goku, which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape. Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha. Just as the two power up even more, the Great Priest puts an end to the fight. As Toppo leaves, he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren (ジレン). The Great Priest begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power. In the Sacred World of the Kais, Beerus and Goku get into an argument over Goku's constant relaxed and negligent attitude, which Whis breaks up. The group agrees to convene at the Capsule Corporation to discuss their future strategy.

Goku and the others arrive at Capsule Corporation. They discuss who should be on the team. Goku immediately suggests Monaka, but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and cannot participate. Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta, Piccolo, Krillin, Master Roshi, No. 18, and No. 17, which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine. Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience. They proceed to ask Vegeta, who has been thinking of a name for his second child. Vegeta refuses to participate. He says he will not fight, while Bulma is pregnant. Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight. Everyone celebrates the baby's birth. Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother. As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta, he develops an attachment to her. Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot. However, Vegeta quickly accepts Bulla's name. Goku leaves to recruit members and heads to Krillin's house.

Goku and Gohan arrive at Krillin's house and ask him and No. 18 to join the Tournament of Power. No. 18 convinces Krillin to participate in order to put his newfound martial arts training to use. No. 18 is reluctant to join herself. She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them, but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward, which convinces her to participate. Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast. After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat, Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea. Goku is excited by Krillin's new power. He challenges him to a sparring match as well. They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan, where Krillin's strategies make up for the gap in power, forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan. Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form, and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash. As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin, No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku's Kamehameha, just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion. She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku cannot expect to fight one-on-one all the time. Goku concedes the match and realizes he will have to adjust his tactics in order to win the Tournament of Power. No. 18 reveals that No. 17 is currently working at a wildlife reserve, but she does not know where. Goku decides to ask Dende to find No. 17.

Dende also reveals that Kid Buu has reincarnated as a young Earthling with massive fighting potential and asks Goku to train him when he is old enough. They reach the island as Goku arrives just in time to witness No. 17 defeat a group of armed poachers. As they introduce themselves to each other, a large army of poachers arrive. Goku and No. 17 team up to subdue them all. Afterwards, No. 17 explains that the poachers are after the last Minotaurus in order to steal its rare and valuable horns. The two decide to have a sparring match. No. 17 evenly matches Super Saiyan Goku, which causes him to turn Super Saiyan Blue. Goku launches a Kamehameha at No. 17, who easily deflects it with an energy shield. The two go toe-to-toe until No. 17 ends the match in order to avoid catching the island in the crossfire. Goku and No. 17 acknowledge that they were both holding back in the fight. Afterwards, Goku attempts to convince him to join the Tournament of Power, but No. 17 is uninterested.

Goku decides to make Tien the tenth member of the team, and heads off to recruit him and Roshi. At Tien's dojo, a woman named Yurin (ユーリン, Yūrin) with a grudge against Tien arrives and requests to join the dojo. Although Tien denies her because her motivation of beauty was unfit for his dojo, Roshi drags Yurin off to ogle her. Goku arrives and asks Tien to join the Tournament of Power, but, even after Goku bribes him with 10 million Zeni, Tien refuses. Yurin escapes Roshi's advances and uses witchcraft to drive Tien's students on a rampage throughout town. Goku, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Roshi arrive at the village, where Yurin confronts them. Yurin explains that she is a former classmate of Tien's during his time at the Crane School and that she swore revenge on him after he left the school and refused to fight her. Meanwhile, Cabba sways Caulifla into joining Universe 6's team by promising to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan. Back on Earth, while Goku, Chiaotzu, and Tien cure the students of their brainwashing, Roshi battles Yurin. He lowers his guard after catching a glimpse of Yurin's panties, which allows her to brainwash him. The brainwashed Roshi quickly defeats Tien, but Goku intervenes. While Chiaotzu temporarily disables Yurin, Goku subdues Roshi with a Kamehameha and cures him of the brainwashing. Tien orders Yurin to apologize to everyone she hurt and offers her a place at his dojo.

The Universe 7 team are unaware that a spy from Universe 4 is observing them. In Universe 6, Cabba and Caulifla attempt to teach Kale how to turn into a Super Saiyan but to no avail. Kale begins to despair over her own uselessness, and it enrages her enough to trigger her transformation into an extremely powerful Berserker Super Saiyan. Kale immediately goes berserk and attacks Cabba. Caulifla quickly deduces that Kale is jealous of her and Cabba's perceived relationship. She denies having any sort of feelings for Cabba. Kale calms down and collapses in Caulifla's arms. Cabba, who is impressed by Kale's power, decides to add her to Universe 6's team. Back in Universe 7, Goku arrives in the afterlife and receives King Yemma's permission to visit Frieza. He explains about the Tournament of Power and asks Frieza to join them. Frieza agrees to aid him on the condition that he be properly resurrected with Earth's Dragon Balls.

In Universe 4, Ganos (ガノス, Ganosu) reports Universe 7's latest actions to Universe 4's God of Destruction Quitela (キテラ, Kitera) and Supreme Kai Kuru (クル).

The assassins' leader, who has been directly empowered by Sidra, attacks Frieza with Sidra's power, but Frieza manages to overcome and hijack the attack. Frieza spitefully uses the attack on Goku and traps him. Frieza tortures and kills the assassins until they reveal that Roh and Sidra hired them. Frieza contacts Universe 9 and offers his services as a defector. Roh and Sidra begin arguing about whether or not to accept him. Roh fears Frieza's psychopathic and treasonous nature, while Sidra wants his power. Sidra is confident he could kill him if he stepped out of line. Their argument buys time for Beerus and Whis to arrive and rescue Goku. Frieza cuts the connection. He begins making plans to use the Tournament of Power to manipulate the gods to suit his own ends. Goku and Frieza have a brief sparring match, which ends in a draw. Goku, Frieza, Beerus, and Whis return to the Capsule Corporation.

Afterwards, the Great Priest forces them all to clean up their mess and fix the stage. In Universe 7, Gohan and Shin's strategy is to have the team members stick together to conserve energy and use strength of numbers to defeat anyone who attacks them. This suggestion offends Goku and Vegeta's Saiyan pride. Whis transports the team to the World of Void. All of the other universes arrive. Frieza and Frost befriend each other and agree to work together, while Goku singles out Jiren as a potential rival due to his extreme power.

Roh orders his warriors to attack Goku to avenge their defeat at the Zen Exhibition Match. Goku is forced to avoid fighting at his fullest in order to conserve stamina for later in the tournament. He fights Team Universe 9, where the Trio de Dangers brothers manage to overwhelm him thanks to their teamwork. Vegeta notices Goku's plight and reinforces him. Roh sends over three more fighters. Team Universe 9 is able to push Goku and Vegeta to the brink until Vegeta tricks Lavender and Hop (ソレル, Hoppu) into accidentally hitting each other. Goku and Vegeta take advantage of the confusion to defeat five of the Universe 9 warriors. No. 18 and Frieza each defeat Sorrel (ソレル, Soreru) and Roselle. Only Basil, Lavender, and Bergamo remain in the tournament for Team Universe 9. Goku and Vegeta push them to the edge of the stage. The brothers use a combination beam as a last ditch effort, but Goku and Vegeta power up to Super Saiyan Blue and knock them off the stage with a Final Kamehameha. With all 10 members defeated, Universe 9 is eliminated from the tournament. As a result, the Zenō-samas erase Universe 9, Roh, Sidra, and all of their fighters.

Krillin rescues No. 18, and the two defeat Shosa with a powerful combination attack. They are challenged by Universe 4's Majora (マジョラ), who is a blind fighter that uses his powerful sense of smell to locate his enemies in battle. Although Majora proves to be stronger than Krillin, Krillin disables his nose by throwing his smelly shoe at him and knocks him off the stage. Krillin boasts about his victory, which allows Frost to knock him off with a single blow. Beerus and Shin berate Krillin for his carelessness with 43 minutes remaining in the tournament.

They knock her unconscious and attempt to throw her off the stage, but Caulifla rescues her and defeats Napapa. The two confront Goku, and Caulifla knocks away Universe 2's Jimeze (ジーミズ, Jimizu) and demands to know how to become a Super Saiyan Blue. Goku refuses, and Caulifla transforms into an Ultra Super Saiyan. However, her increased muscle mass cripples her speed and allows Goku to counterattack. With Goku's aid, Caulifla manages to become a Super Saiyan 2, and the two resume their fight. As Kale watches them, she is once again consumed by her feelings of uselessness and transforms into her Berserker Super Saiyan form. Hit uses his time skip to save Caulifla from getting caught in the crossfire. Kale flies into a jealous rage and attacks Goku for allegedly stealing Caulifla from her. Kale easily overwhelms Goku and forces him to power up to Super Saiyan Blue. He unleashes a powerful Kamehameha, but Kale powers through it unharmed. As Piccolo realizes she has lost control of her power, Kale begins firing ki blasts at everything in sight and defeats Methiop. When Universe 11's Vuon (ブーオン, Būon) attempts to stop her, Kale defeats him as well. Jiren knocks her unconscious with a single ki blast.

As Goku prepares to fight Jiren, Toppo suddenly ambushes him with a barrage of ki blasts. Toppo and Jiren decide to retreat and conserve their stamina. This leaves Goku to be dealt with by Kahseral and their fellow Pride Troopers Tupper (タッパー, Tappā), Zoiray (ゾイレー, Zoirē), Cocotte (ココット, Kokotto), and Kettol. The five declare their intent to defeat Caulifla and Kale to avenge Vuon's defeat. The two are forced to form a temporary alliance with Goku. Meanwhile, Master Roshi and Tien team up to defeat Universe 3's The Preecho (ザ・プリーチョ). They regroup with Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Frieza, where he has defeated Murichim. The Pride Troopers push Goku, Caulifla, and Kale to the brink, but No. 17 and No. 18 rescue them. No. 18 and Goku defeat Tupper, while No. 17 easily overpowers Kahseral. The remaining Pride Troopers regroup and focus their assault on the wounded Caulifla and Kale. Cocotte seals them in a separate dimension to ensure that Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 do not interfere. As the four beat Caulifla, Kale's self-hatred causes her to return to the Berserker Super Saiyan form, but she remains in control of herself this time. Caulifla and Kale use an extremely powerful combination ki blast to defeat Kahseral, Zoiray, and Kettol. Cocotte seals herself in a mini-dimension to avoid the blast, but No. 18 simply throws it off, eliminating Cocotte. Goku allows Caulifla and Kale to retreat so he can fight them at their full strength after they rest. The group is unaware that Brianne is observing them.

No. 17 blasts them before they can transform, but Brianne, Goku, and Toppo berate him for his dishonorable tactics and browbeat him into allowing them to transform, much to Beerus' dismay. They assume their alter-egos Ribrianne, Kakunsa (カクンサ, Kakunsa), and Rozie (ロージィ, Rōjī) and barrage the arena with a powerful love-based attack that brainwashes some of the fighters. Universe 7's mental discipline allows them to overcome its effects. Gohan's group elects to split up and fight independently. Vegeta attacks Ribrianne, who counters with a rolling attack that knocks out Universe 10's Jirasen (ジラセン). Rozie attacks Goku with a flurry of blows that grows more powerful the longer she keeps it up, while Kakunsa battles No. 17 with her animalistic fighting style. No. 17 baits her into overextending herself and stuns her with a barrier. He attempts to knock her out of the stage, but her teammate Vikal (ビカル, Bikaru) rescues her.

Universe 10's Obuni (オブニ) and Rubalt (ルバルト, Rubaruto) appear to challenge Gohan and Piccolo. Jimeze defeats Universe 10's Jilcol (ジルコル Jirukoru). With 8 warriors eliminated, Gowasu accepts his imminent demise, while Rumsshi remains defiant. Obuni shifts his ki away from his body to render himself impossible to detect and wounds Gohan. Rubalt initially has the upper hand against Piccolo, but Piccolo uses his Hellzone Grenade attack to knock out Rubalt, leaving Universe 10 with only Obuni. Obuni begins to overwhelm Gohan, which makes Gowasu want to cling to life again. Gohan powers up and powers through one of Obuni's punches. He counterattacks Obuni's moves by locating and hitting Obuni after he gets hit. Obuni pauses the fight to show his respect for Gohan, but refuses to lose for the sake of Universe 10. Gohan battles and defeats Obuni with a Kamehameha. All of Universe 10's fighters have been eliminated.

Everyone quickly deduces that Dyspo is listening for the sound of Hit's body tensing up to determine when he is about to attempt to use Time Skip. Hit resorts to fighting him conventionally, but he is pushed to the edge of the stage. Toppo deduces that Hit has adjusted to Dyspo's fighting style and is luring him into a trap. Toppo sends fellow pride trooper Kunshi (クンシー, Kunshī) to back him up. Before Dyspo can land the finishing blow, Hit suddenly turns intangible and sends Dyspo over the edge. However, Kunshi uses ropes made of his energy to pull Dyspo back onto the stage before he is eliminated. The two launch a renewed assault against Hit and drive him into a corner. Before they can finish him off, Goku interferes and rescues Hit. Goku uses his Super Saiyan God form to counter Dyspo's speed, while Hit uses his assassination technique to injure Kunshi.

Master Roshi quietly observes the battles from afar. He is challenged by an attractive warrior from Universe 4, Caway (キャウェイ, Kyauei), who attempts to seduce him. However, Caway's attempts to attack him brings him back to his senses. Roshi destroys her energy weapon, powers up, and drives her to jump off the stage. Roshi is next challenged by Dercori (ダーコリ, Dākori), who is a talisman-wielding warrior from Universe 4. She uses her talismans to confound Roshi with illusions and trap him in a single spot. Roshi uses the Evil Containment Wave to seal her in a small bottle and throw her off the arena. Quitela and Beerus get into an argument about the legality of the move, which is defused when both Zenō-samas rule in Roshi's favor. Ganos, who is enraged at Roshi for eliminating his friends, challenges him and powers up into an avian form. Initially, Roshi is able to use his experience to predict, evade, and counter Ganos' attacks. However, Ganos is able to grow more powerful the longer a fight drags on. He rallies and delivers a fierce series of blows to Roshi. Roshi attempts to hypnotize Ganos into falling asleep, but he attacks himself to wake himself up. Ganos demands that Roshi accept his limits and give up, but Roshi refuses. He unleashes a Max Power Kamehameha that defeats Ganos. However, the effort is too much for Roshi's body to handle, and he collapses. Goku races over to him and successfully defibrillates him with his ki. Goku escorts Roshi to safety.

Goku brings Master Roshi to an isolated part of the stage and leaves him to rest at his request. Gohan and Piccolo are confronted by Universe 6's Dr. Rota (Dr.ロタ, Dokutā Rota), but Rota is shot down by a sniper before he can reveal his ability. Gohan and Piccolo are unable to find the location of the sniper until they find a red orb on the ground. It is revealed that the sniper, Universe 2's Prum (プラン, Puran), can see through these orbs. The lasers ricochet off of the orbs so that his true location is a secret. Piccolo tries to create a smokescreen in order to blur the vision, but Prum can still see them via their heat signatures. Prum shoots Piccolo and destroys both of his arms, which forces him to painfully regenerate them. Gohan and Piccolo realize that the orbs depend on heat signatures and blast the surrounding area to create multiple heat signatures. Prum responds by coming out of his hiding spot and blasting the entire area. Gohan and Piccolo are forced into hiding. Tien analyzes Dr. Rota and deduces that he was hit by a sniper as Goku and Vegeta arrive. Vegeta berates Tien, who warns them about Prum, but Vegeta arrogantly brushes it off until he is almost incapacitated by one of Prum's blasts. As Goku and Tien observe Prum, they deduce that there is another shooter from behind as Prum is merely reflecting the blasts. Vegeta and Goku go after Prum, while Tien goes to save Gohan and Piccolo. Goku and Vegeta try to attack Prum, but their ki blasts are reflected off of his body. Tien navigates through the field of blasts and confronts the true sniper, Prum's teammate Hermila (ハーミラ, Hāmira). Realizing that Prum can deflect ki blasts and not physical attacks, Vegeta and Goku throw giant boulders at him. Tien uses his Multi-form technique in order to buy himself time against Hermila, but three of his clones are shot down. The fourth and final Tien defeats Hermila. Just as Tien is about to eliminate him, Hermila shoots the ground underneath Tien's feet and knocks him off the stage. However, Tien's other three clones come back and drag Hermila down with them. Tien and Hermila are eliminated from the tournament. Although Beerus praises Tien for forcing the battle into a draw, Tien is noticeably upset about being defeated. As Prum is confronted by Vegeta, Dr. Rota comes back and attacks Prum as revenge for shooting him. Shortly after, Vegeta eliminates Prum and Dr. Rota from the tournament.

Magetta arrives to reinforce Frost, and the two battle Vegeta. Frost goads Roshi into using the Evil Containment Wave on Magetta despite the risk of killing himself. When Roshi falls for it, Frost reflects the attack and seals Vegeta into a bottle. With the last of his strength, Roshi uses a small ki blast to destroy the bottle and free Vegeta.

Jimeze makes use of his Instant Transmission technique to confound and damage Gohan. As he prepares to finish him, Frieza intervenes. When Frieza does not immediately attack Jimeze, Universe 7's spectators speculate he may intend to betray and defeat Gohan so he can seize the wish on the Super Dragon Balls for himself. Frieza steps aside and allows Jimeze to continue his fight with Gohan. Jimeze corners Gohan again and attempts to finish him, but Frieza destroys his attack with a ki blast. Enraged, Jimeze attacks Frieza, who swiftly tortures and eliminates him. Frost appears and declares his intention to defeat Gohan, and Frieza admits that the two intend to work together in order to exact revenge on the Saiyans. Frieza battles Gohan, who counterattacks. Frieza uses his Golden form to knock out Gohan. However, instead of eliminating him, he double-crosses and eliminates Frost. Gohan admits that he immediately figured out Frieza's plan and played along with him. An enraged Frost attempts to attack Frieza from the spectator stands, but Zenō-sama erases him, who explains this is forbidden and Universe 6 would be erased upon a second offence.

Goku considers using the wish to benefit his family or meet a strong opponent. Ribrianne absorbs the love of her teammates and becomes Super Ribrianne. She attacks Goku with several ki blasts, and he counters by turning Super Saiyan Blue and knocking her away. Ribrianne lands near Jiren, and Goku sees him and prepares to finally battle him. Universe 11's God of Destruction, Belmod, telepathically orders Jiren to defeat Goku. Belmod hopes to demoralize the other universes by defeating the strongest fighter besides Jiren himself. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20, but that proves to be no match for Jiren's overwhelming power. Goku begins powering up a Spirit Bomb, and all of his teammates except Vegeta lend him their energy. Despite the time it takes to charge the attack, Jiren agrees to wait for him to complete it. Ribrianne attempts to attack Goku from behind, but she is stopped by Vegeta. Goku completes the Spirit Bomb and throws it, but Jiren deflects it. The two engage in a struggle to take control of the Spirit Bomb. This forces Goku to use Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20 to keep up.

Goku rallies himself and pushes the Spirit Bomb back towards Jiren, which locks him in a stalemate. Whis realizes that Jiren is at least as powerful as a God of Destruction. As the two struggle to overpower each other, the Spirit Bomb suddenly condenses into a small black ball, which absorbs Goku and causes him to vanish. The Great Priest rules that since Goku's own attack apparently vaporized him, Jiren will not be disqualified for destroying him. As the Zenō-samas prepare to eliminate Goku, he suddenly reappears and reaches a new level of power. Goku resumes the fight, and he is able to go toe-to-toe with Jiren. Whis theorizes Goku must have absorbed the Spirit Bomb and unlocked an ability called Ultra Instinct (身勝手の極意, Migatte no Goku'i'). Goku uses another powerful attack in an attempt to eliminate Jiren, but he fails and exhausts his newfound power. Jiren knocks him away, and Hit attempts to take advantage of the opportunity and attacks Jiren.

Instead of killing the defenseless Goku, Frieza shares with him some of his energy and repays his act of mercy during their fight on Planet Namek. Meanwhile, Hit uses his time-skip powers against Jiren, but his attacks fail to connect. Goku spectates the battle, but he is ambushed by Saonel (サオネル, Saoneru) and Pirina (ピリナ, Pirina), Namekians from Universe 6, who are confronted by Gohan and Piccolo. Elsewhere, Vegeta fights Ribrianne, and he is easily overpowering her in his base form until Rozie interferes and retreats with Ribrianne. Ribrianne loses hope due to the gap in power, but Rozie motivates her. Meanwhile, Hit keeps attacking Jiren to no avail, but he is able to react and block most of Jiren's punches. After being knocked back, Hit sneaks up behind Jiren and lands a strong punch on his heart. He knocks Jiren to the edge of the ring after a brief struggle. Hit uses his own time-skip powers continually on Jiren to stop his movement. Realizing that he cannot hold Jiren for long, Hit urges Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale to keep fighting for Universe 6. Hit pools all his energy in a final attack to defeat him, but Jiren stops Hit's attack only with his glare. Jiren breaks free and eliminates Hit. As the Tournament of Power reaches its midway point, Jiren begins to meditate. He is certain that there are no other warriors strong enough to fight him. Jiren leaves the fight to Toppo and Dyspo. Viara (ビアラ, Biara) and Katopesla (カトペスラ, Katopesura) of Universe 3 attempt to attack him while meditating, but Jiren's energy alone is enough to push them back.

Caulifla and Kale are discussing the battle between Goku and Jiren, when they are confronted by Monna (モンナ, Monna), a female warrior from Universe 4. Caulifla faces off against Monna, but Cabba appears and takes her place. He instructs Caulifla and Kale to retreat for now. Cabba turns Super Saiyan and battles Monna, but he is initially overpowered. Monna almost knocks Cabba off the stage, but Vegeta intervenes and catches him before he can fall. Vegeta and Cabba both promise that, if either of them wins the tournament, the winner will use the Super Dragon Balls to restore the other's erased universe and its inhabitants. Newly inspired, Cabba fights Monna again, but he is losing until he taps into his anger and unlocks Super Saiyan 2. With his new power, Cabba easily defeats and eliminates Monna.

Eventually, she is able to adapt to his moves, which forces Goku to power up to Super Saiyan 2 himself. The two of them fight evenly for some time. Goku later calls in Kale to join the battle. His superior power and skill enables him to fight them both at once, but they are able to match him by working together. They land a massive combined attack on him, but Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 3 and easily deflects their attacks. However, Goku lacks the stamina to maintain that form and reverts to Super Saiyan 2. Kale's desire to become stronger inadvertently causes her to transform into her Berserker Super Saiyan form again.

To counter Goku's increase in power, Kefla powers up to Super Saiyan 2, and the two of them face off. Goku still easily dodges Kefla's attacks, but his own attacks are not enough to take her down. When Goku launches his attacks, it interferes with his concentration and prevents him from using Ultra Instinct to its full potential. Jiren senses the energy from their battle, which prompts him to awaken from his meditation and rejoin Toppo and Dyspo. Vegeta realizes that Ultra Instinct is the level of skill that Whis was training him and Goku to attain. Vegeta decides that he must reach it too. Goku begins running low on stamina. He declares that he will end the fight with his next attack. Kefla panics and unleashes a multitude of deadly energy beams. Her ultimate attack devastates the ring, but Goku easily dodges her blasts while charging a Kamehameha. Goku jumps into the air. Kefla focuses all of her power into a single blast and launches it at him. She takes advantage of his apparent inability to dodge. However, he back flips and uses the charge up energy to slide over her attack and launches his Kamehameha at point-blank range. Goku blasts Kefla out of the ring and eliminates her. Her Potara earrings shatter, and she splits back into Kale and Caulifla. With both of them eliminated, Saonel and Pirina are the only remaining warriors from Team Universe 6.

Goku is left exhausted from his battle with Kefla. He is confronted by all five remaining warriors from Universe 2. Gohan and Piccolo try to help him, but they are intercepted by Saonel and Pirina. Elsewhere, Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and tries to unlock Ultra Instinct against him. However, he is unsuccessful and resorts to his normal fighting style. Vegeta easily overpowers Katopesla. Rozie and Ribrianne launch a combined attack at Goku, but No. 17 and No. 18 arrive in time to deflect it. The androids battle Rozie and Ribrianne. No. 17 defeats and eliminates Rozie, while No. 18 knocks Ribrianne out of her powered-up transformation. This causes her to revert into Brianne. Brianne is able to catch No. 18 in an energy trap, while her comrades from Universe 2 send their love to her. This allows Brianne to transform into a giant manifestation version of her Super Ribrianne form. No. 18 almost gives up until her love for Krillin and Marron gives her the determination to break free of Ribrianne's trap. With No. 17's help, No. 18 blasts through Ribrianne's giant form and eliminates her. Brianne realizes that she lost because of No. 18's strong love for Krillin, while Goku faces off against Zirloin (ザーロイン, Zāroin), Zarbuto, and Rabanra of Universe 2.

Goku battles against Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra from Universe 2, while Gohan and Piccolo are fighting against Saonel and Pirina. Saonel and Pirina's power suddenly increases, and it is revealed that they had each fused with many Namekians from their universe before coming to the tournament, which greatly increased their own powers. No. 17 and No. 18 join Goku to help in the battle against the remaining Universe 2 warriors. It is revealed that Universe 2's angel, Sour (サワア, Sawaa), has been broadcasting the tournament to the populace of their universe. Universe 2's inhabitants channel their love to Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, who are able to transform into forms similar to Ribrianne, Rozie, and Kakunsa's transformed states. Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 battle Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo continue fighting Saonel and Pirina. The Universe 2 trio unleash a legendary Universe 2 technique, the Pretty Black Hole, which traps and threatens to sink Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 through the fighting stage. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue and breaks through the Pretty Black Hole with a Kamehameha that eliminates Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo blast Saonel and Pirina off the ring with a powerful combined attack that eliminates them as well. With all of their fighters eliminated, both Universe 2 and Universe 6 are erased. Brianne leads the Universe 2 team in a final happy moment before their erasure, while Cabba wishes Vegeta good luck. Champa taunts Beerus before being erased. Beerus remains impassive in the face of his brother's erasure. Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and warns him that he is in a bad mood.

Vegeta overpowers Katopesla and drives him to the edge of the ring. Katopesla is able to catch himself, but he is pushed over the edge and eliminated by an unseen force. Vegeta and Gohan are attacked by the same force, but Vegeta is able to stop himself from going over the edge, while Piccolo catches Gohan. No. 18 is attacked by the invisible fighter, who is revealed to be one of the missing Universe 4 fighters, Gamisaras (ガミサラス, Gamisarasu). Gohan creates a cloud of dust that coats Gamisaras, which allows Piccolo to see him and then easily eliminates Gamisaras. Undaunted, Quitela orders the remaining Universe 4 fighters to step up their game. Shantza (シャンツァ, Shantsa) generates a dome that envelops the Universe 7 team and manifests illusions of the defeated fighters from the erased universes. However, Piccolo spots Shantza and blasts him off the ring, which eliminates him and destroys the illusions. Universe 4's last fighter, Damon (ダモン, Damon), is also assumed to be invisible since no one can see him. Piccolo is able to sense Damon's attacks, but he proves unable to hit Damon, who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him. No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug-like creature rather than an invisible person, which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him. To solve this problem, Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air, which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts. No. 17 traps Damon in a miniature force field and kicks him out of the ring to eliminate him. With all of their fighters eliminated, Universe 4 is promptly erased.

Following the elimination of Universe 4, the remaining fighters from Universe 3 take the offensive against Universe 7. While Viara is defeated and eliminated by No. 17 and No. 18's combined efforts, Paparoni (パパロニ, Paparoni) sends Panchia, Koitsukai, and Bollarator to attack Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta. To help Goku and Vegeta save their energy to confront Universe 11, Gohan decides to face the three robots alone. He gains the upper hand until Paparoni has them combine together into a much stronger robot called Koichiarator (コイチアレータ, Koichiarēta). Koichiarator overpowers Gohan until Goku and Vegeta step in. The two distract the enemy, while Gohan charges and strikes with an attack powerful enough to defeat it. With his robots defeated, Paparoni refuses to surrender and declares that he will unleash his trump card on Universe 7.

Paparoni and Koichiarator merge to form Anilaza (アニラーザ, Anirāza), the most powerful warrior from Universe 3. Anilaza begins to overwhelm the Saiyans, which forces No. 17 and No. 18 to reinforce them. The five attempt to coordinate their attacks to catch Anilaza off-guard, but he deflects them all. It is revealed that Anilaza can use echolocation to detect his opponents' movements. Anilaza begins teleporting his punches, and he nearly knocks Goku off the stage until Frieza steps in and knocks him back into the arena. Realizing that the Universe 7 warriors will rescue each other from defeat, Anilaza attempts to eat No. 18, who is rescued by Goku. Anilaza corners No. 17 and overwhelms him. He knocks him off the fighting stage, but No. 18 sacrifices herself to kick No. 17 back onto the fighting stage. She is eliminated from the tournament. With no other options, the Universe 7 warriors power up to their maximum levels and engage in a ki clash with Anilaza. They buy time for No. 17 to pierce through Anilaza's attack and damage his energy reactor. This enables the others to overwhelm and eliminate Anilaza. With all of their warriors eliminated, Universe 3 is erased. As the Universe 7 warriors begin to celebrate, the remaining Universe 11 warriors step forward to challenge them.

With only two universes remaining, the Great Priest compresses the bleachers so that everyone is brought together. The final warriors begin to fight each other. Gohan and No. 17 battle Toppo. Frieza fights Dyspo. Goku and Vegeta battle Jiren. Jiren overwhelms Goku with a flurry of punches. Vegeta analyzes his patterns and dodges his attacks. He lands a solid blow to Jiren's midsection. Jiren counters with a powerful blast that nearly rings Vegeta out. Meanwhile, Frieza blocks one of Dyspo's attacks with his tail, but Dyspo uses it as leverage to injure him. Jiren disparages Vegeta for his self-righteousness, but Vegeta declares that it is the source of his strength. He powers up a Final Flash and goads Jiren into taking it head-on. However, the attack fails to damage Jiren, who acknowledges the power of Vegeta's attack before incapacitating him.

887,Species,when are organisms considered to belong to the same species,"In biology, a species is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank, as well as a unit of biodiversity, but it has proven difficult to find a satisfactory definition. Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work, regardless of the theoretical difficulties. If as Linnaeus thought, species were fixed, there would be no problem, but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually, and to grade into one another. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, when looked at more closely it is problematic. For example, with hybridisation, in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies, or in a ring species, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear. Among organisms that reproduce only asexually, the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, and each clone is potentially a microspecies. Problems also arise when dealing with fossils, since reproduction cannot be examined; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology. Other ways of defining species include their karyotype, DNA sequence, morphology, behaviour or ecological niche.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
888,Alamo Mission in San Antonio,when was the mission san antonio de valero built,"In 1716, the Spanish government established several Roman Catholic missions in East Texas. The isolation of the missions—the nearest Spanish settlement, San Juan Bautista, Coahuila was over 400 miles (644 km) away—made it difficult to keep them adequately provisioned.[7] To assist the missionaries, the new governor of Spanish Texas, Martín de Alarcón, wished to establish a way station between the settlements along the Rio Grande and the new missions in East Texas.[8] In April 1718, Alarcón led an expedition to found a new community in Texas.[9] On May 1, the group erected a temporary mud, brush, and straw structure near the headwaters of the San Antonio River.[8][9] This building would serve as a new mission, San Antonio de Valero, named after Saint Anthony of Padua and the viceroy of New Spain, Baltasar de Zúñiga y Guzmán Sotomayor y Sarmiento, Marquess of Valero. The mission, headed by Father Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares, was located near a community of Coahuiltecans and was initially populated by three to five Indian converts from Mission San Francisco Solano near San Juan Bautista.[9][10] One mile (two km) north of the mission, Alarcón built a presidio (fort), the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar.

900,Electric chair,when did they stop using the electric chair in america,"Although the electric chair has long been a symbol of the death penalty in the United States, its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection, which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution. Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution, today, it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner, except in Tennessee, where it may be used if the drugs for lethal injection are not available, without input from the prisoner.[4] As of 2014, electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, and Virginia. They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method. In the state of Kentucky, the electric chair has been retired, except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998, and who choose electrocution; inmates who do not choose electrocution and inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are executed by lethal injection. In the state of Tennessee, the electric chair is available for use if lethal injection drugs are unavailable, or otherwise, if the inmate so chooses and if their capital crime was committed before 1999. The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution. On February 8, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a ""cruel and unusual punishment"" under the state's constitution. This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska, the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution.[5]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
901,Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913,when was the cat and mouse act introduced,"The Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act, commonly referred to as the Cat and Mouse Act, was an Act of Parliament passed in Britain under Herbert Henry Asquith's Liberal government in 1913. Some members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU, commonly referred to as suffragettes) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women's suffrage. In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes. These suffragettes were then force-fed leading to a public outcry.[1] This act was a response to the outcry; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health. They then had a period of time in which they could recover. After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence. Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release.[2] The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal. However, the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges. The nickname of the Act came about because of a cat's habit of playing with its prey (a mouse) before finishing it off.",NONE,1913,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, the band begins, as the smoke and the lights are turned on, we see Wyatt ""Dusty"" Chandler (George Strait) entering the stage, and performing ""Heartland"", ""Baby Your Baby"", and a shortened version of ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"". Dusty feels that his elaborate stage show is overwhelming his music, a suspicion confirmed one night when he purposely forgets several bars of a chart-topping hit and his fans don't even notice. Disillusioned, Dusty walks off after the concert without telling his manager, Lula (Lesley Ann Warren). The only person he tells is his best friend and drummer, Earl (John Doe), and that he is ""taking a walk,"" but does not say exactly where he is going or for how long. Dusty is singing a blurry version of ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"". In a down home bar, we see Al (Mark Walters). Dusty had breakfast with the Tucker family during this scene.",NONE,George Strait,,,,,,,,,,,,

Use of instrument flight rules is also required when flying in ""Class A"" airspace regardless of weather conditions. Class A airspace extends from 18,000 feet above mean sea level to flight level 600 (60,000 feet pressure altitude) above the contiguous 48 United States and overlying the waters within 12 miles thereof.[8] Flight in Class A airspace requires pilots and aircraft to be instrument equipped and rated and to be operating under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). In many countries commercial airliners and their pilots must operate under IFR as the majority of flights enter Class A airspace; however, aircraft operating as commercial airliners must operate under IFR even if the flight plan does not take the craft into Class A airspace, such as with smaller regional flights.[9] Procedures and training are significantly more complex compared to VFR instruction, as a pilot must demonstrate competency in conducting an entire cross-country flight solely by reference to instruments.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NFL contributes up to $5,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for o the winning team; any additional costs are borne by the team.[1] Most rings are manufactured by memorabilia company Jostens. In 2015, the rings for the New England Patriots reportedly cost $36,500 each, making them the most expensive rings Jostens has ever produced.[2] The winning team can typically present rings to whomever they choose, including usually, but not limited to: players (active roster or injured), coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general staff. Some teams have given rings to former players and coaches that were on the team at some point during the season, despite not having been on the winning roster for the Super Bowl itself.[3][4] Sometimes a team will give rings to fans as part of a charity raffle.[5] Teams can distribute any number of rings. A recent trend over the last 15â€“20 years has been lesser rings awarded to front office staff. These are commonly called ""B"" and ""C"" level rings and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or contain faux diamonds. The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones (which resemble diamonds). When Tampa Bay won Super Bowl XXXVII, the players and coaches received rings with a diamond-centered Lombardi trophy. Some staff received rings with a metal Lombardi trophy and real diamonds surrounding the trophy and the ""C"" level ring did not contain any diamonds.",NONE,New England Patriots,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iris has been aiding Team Flash in Central City for six months, but refuses to grieve Barry. A flying samurai with superpowers appears in Central City, threatening to destroy the city if the real Flash does not face him. Cisco reveals he has formulated a way to bring back Barry without destabilizing the Speed Force and tracks down Caitlin for help, but is forbidden by Iris to bring Barry back. Against Iris' orders, Team Flash successfully returns Barry, who rambles random statements and continually writes symbols on the walls. Wally engages the samurai, but is defeated. Cisco deciphers Barry's writings and finds an apparently meaningless sentence. In an attempt to recover Barry's memories, Iris gives herself up to the samurai. The plan works and Barry speeds away, rescuing Iris and defeating the samurai, who is revealed to be an android. Caitlin rejoins Team Flash, but is revealed to have been working for a mobster called Amunet, while also continuing to prevent the Killer Frost personality from emerging. The ""Samuroid"" is revealed to have been controlled by the Thinker, whose plan was to draw out the Flash for his next schemes.

When Barry, Joe, and Cisco report to a crime scene, they discover remnants of a mysterious code. Cisco presents Barry with a technologically advanced suit, intended to facilitate his activities. He tests it out, trying to save someone from a haywire car controlled by metahuman Ramsey Deacon. Gypsy arrives on Earth-1 for a date with Cisco, who is forced to cancel it so as to focus on Deacon. Acting on a suggestion from Caitlin, Iris signs her and Barry up for couples therapy to sort out their relationship. Deacon kidnaps a witness, a former member of a tech team that stole his idea for profit. Barry and Wally go to save him, but Deacon uses his abilities to send Barry's suit haywire. On Iris' instruction, Barry throws lightning at himself, shorting out his suit. He then incapacitates Deacon, who is locked up in the meta wing of Iron Heights, revealed to be part of the Thinker's plan. Cisco finally goes out with Gypsy. Wondering how Deacon gained his powers being absent during the particle accelerator incident, Barry and Joe learn from Deacon that there are ""others.""

In flashbacks, the Thinker observes Becky Sharpe, a woman with seemingly unending bad luck, and determines that she will be easily manipulated. In the present, Becky robs a bank and gets away when Barry slips on marbles. Harry arrives from Earth-2 and tells Wally that Jesse has decided to break up with him in order to focus on her vigilantism. Cisco deduces that Becky is a metahuman with the power of favorable luck while inducing misfortune to others. Barry realizes that the portal he used to escape the Speed Force exposed an entire busload of people, including Becky and Deacon, to transformative dark matter. Harry informs Cisco that Jesse has expelled him from her crime-fighting team due to his attitude. Becky's powers expand out of control, reactivating the particle accelerator, which Harry deliberately allows, nullifying Becky's powers and leading to her incarceration. Cisco and Harry identify twelve new metahumans created on the bus and the latter suspects that an unknown party has manipulated the events surrounding Barry's return. Wally decides to leave on a journey to find himself. The Thinker is revealed to be spying on S.T.A.R. Labs through the ""Samuroid"" helmet. Joe learns Cecile is pregnant.

Singh reveals to Joe he is appearing as a witness for the prosecution against Barry. The meta is eventually discovered as Neil Borman, who is a meta who produces radiation, which is causing the illness and collapsing. Barry takes him on, but is ill equipped to deal with the situation. Cisco and Killer Frost travel to the scene where Caitlin tries to freeze Borman, who quickly defrosts and incapacitates Caitlin. Barry creates a vacuum seal around Borman to contain the radiation, with Cisco transporting the radiation to the dead Earth-15, draining the meta and defeating him.

The next day, Barry meets Axel Walker who was later broken out of prison by his mother Zoey Clark, his father's one-time partner Prank. Axel challenges Ralph by threatening to cause chaos in the city. Ralph attempts to stop him but is wounded by Axel and is evacuated by Cisco. Ralph sneaks into the prison to talk to Barry about how scared he is. Barry reassures him that being a hero isn't about not being scared, but about having the ability to rise above your fear. Cisco and Caitlin go to rescue the hostages, but get captured by Axel and Zoey, who intend to kill them. Ralph arrives, and attempts to shield the two from an acid shower, until Wells manages to hack into the shower system to neutralize its acidity. Iris visits Barry in prison, where they reaffirm their love for each other. Ralph and Cisco go to get coffee, where they meet the excitable girl from the wedding.

Cecile develops telepathic abilities as a result of her pregnancy, combined with dormant dark matter in her cells, which Caitlin assures her should be temporary. In prison, Barry learns that Ratchet is innocent of a robbery-homicide that was actually committed by Sylbert Rundine fifteen years prior. Barry asks the team to look into the case. Rundine turns out to be a bus meta with the ability to shrink and enlarge objects, and he shrinks Cisco and Ralph while escaping. Harry's attempted cure backfires, and Caitlin determines that if they are not re-enlarged within a certain period of time, their bodies will explode. The team confronts Rundine at a warehouse, where Harry tricks him into re-enlarging Ralph and Cisco. Rundine is arrested, but refuses to confess to the earlier crime. Barry gathers that even if Ratchet went free, he would be as unhappy in the city as he is in prison; he wishes to live in a secluded Chinese village called Jiaju, but fears he will never get there. Barry then uses his speed to take Ratchet to Jiaju, where he can live out his dream. After discovering Barry is the Flash, the prison's warden, Gregory Wolfe, locks Barry in his private metahuman wing, intending to sell him to Amunet.

Wolfe plans to sell Barry and the imprisoned bus metas (Ramsey Deacon, Becky Sharpe, Mina Chaytan, and Sylbert Rundine) to Amunet, so they plan to escape. Cecile discovers Wolfe's plans after reading his mind. Ralph encounters a former colleague and his negative interaction with him prompts the discovery that he can shapeshift. His lack of mastery of the new ability prevents his attempt to foil Amunet's deal with Wolfe. Barry helps the metas escape the power dampeners, but they are cornered by Wolfe and Amunet. DeVoe arrives and again uses his chair to extract the metas' abilities, before transferring his mind into Sharpe's body. He then crushes Wolfe's skull as Marlize looks on in horror; Amunet flees. Ralph uses his shapeshifting ability to appear as the original DeVoe at Barry's appeal, claiming that he was unconscious at Barry's loft but not dead, which clears Barry's name. Team Flash realizes that DeVoe is only stealing powers from metahumans who were on the bus when the dark matter wave was unleashed, which means he will likely target Ralph as well. Back at the DeVoes' house, their marriage continues to deteriorate, and DeVoe drugs his wife with the Weeper's tears to maintain her devotion towards him.

She manages to use her abilities when DeVoe (inside Sharpe's body) comes to claim her. Barry and Ralph help to train Izzy to refine her abilities, which proves difficult when she gets hurt. Eventually DeVoe shows up once again, using Dominic's and Becky's abilities to make Barry experience a brain aneurysm, while using Rundine's abilities to incapacitate Ralph. DeVoe then once again uses the chair to transfer his mind into Izzy's body and escapes. Both Ralph and Barry comfort each other over their respective losses: Barry being let go from the police force and Ralph losing Izzy to DeVoe. These losses enforce both Barry's and Ralph's determination to bring DeVoe down and save the three remaining metas.

Jesse comes to Earth-1 to have a talk with her dad. Eco-terrorist Veronica Dale sets off a nuclear bomb, which Barry tries to stop, entering a form of superspeed known as Flashtime, where everything is frozen. However, the bomb has already detonated, and he and Jesse cannot stop it or save everyone with superspeed. Jay Garrick comes from Earth-3 to help, but they are still unable to stop it. Barry remains in Flashtime for hours, bringing each of his friends into it, in an attempt to find a solution; they discuss options such as freezing it or sending it to another Earth, but none of those solutions prove to be viable. Eventually, Iris gives him the idea to retrieve the Quark Sphere from the Speed Force to send a blast lightning through the bomb, enough to disable it. Barry does so, and throws the Sphere back into the Speed Force, saving Central City. Jay admits he is retiring and going to train a new ""female"" speedster. Jesse and Jay return to their Earths, and Caitlin and Wells go for a coffee, where they encounter the mysterious girl.

970,"My Kinsman, Major Molineux",who is the young man in hawthorne's my kinsman major molineux,"In about 1732, Robin, a youth, arrives by ferry in Boston seeking his kinsman, Major Molineux, an official in the British Colonial government, who has promised him work. Yet no one in town tells him where the major is. A rich man threatens the youth with prison, and an innkeeper calls him a runaway bond-servant. At the inn, he meets a man with a face described as looking like the devil - two protrusions emanating from his forehead (like horns), eyes burning like 'fire in a cave'- who seems at the center of many evil things. Later, he runs into the man again, but this time his face is painted black and red. After blocking his path with a cudgel, he finally gets the answer that his kinsman will soon pass by. He waits at the spot on the steps of a church where he is greeted by the first polite gentleman he has met all night. Soon, the two men hear the roar of an approaching mob. At its head is the man with the red and black face and in its midst is Major Molineux, tarred and feathered. The crowd is in an uproar, and everyone is laughing. Soon, so is young Robin, as his eyes meet those of the Major, who knows him right away. Disillusioned, the youth asks the gentleman the way back to the ferry. Yet the latter restrains him, saying that it is still possible for him to thrive without his kinsman's protection.",NONE,Robin,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a threshold level.

The battle has been passed down in Islamic history as a decisive victory attributable to divine intervention, or by secular sources to the strategic genius of Muhammad. It is one of the few battles specifically mentioned in the Quran. All knowledge of the battle at Badr comes from traditional Islamic accounts, both hadiths and biographies of Muhammad, recorded in written form some time after the battle.

Overall, rainfall is greatest in the east and gradually decreases westward, with some semi-desert areas along the western edge of South Africa. For most of the country, rain falls mainly in the summer months with brief afternoon thunderstorms.

1009,Dust Bowl,when did the dust bowl end in oklahoma,"The Dust Bowl, also known as the Dirty Thirties, was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion (the Aeolian processes) caused the phenomenon. The drought came in three waves, 1934, 1936, and 1939–1940, but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years.[1] With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains, farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade; this had displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds. The rapid mechanization of farm equipment, especially small gasoline tractors, and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers' decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than 10 inches (250 mm) of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland.[2]",NONE,1940,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia. Additionally one other species of camel [3] in the separate genus Camelops, C. hesternus [4] lived in western North America and became extinct when humans entered the continent at the end of the Pleistocene. Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.",NONE,"Bactrian, or two-humped camel (C. bactrianus)",,,,,,,,,,,,

1037,"United States presidential election, 1824",who received the most (but not a majority of) electoral votes in 1824,"The 1824 presidential election marked the final collapse of the Republican-Federalist political framework. Considering the large numbers of candidates and strong regional preferences, it is not surprising that the results of the election of 1824 were inconclusive. The electoral map confirmed the candidates' sectional support, with Adams winning outright in the New England states, Jackson gleaning success in states throughout the nation, Clay attracting votes from the West, and Crawford attracting votes from the eastern South. Andrew Jackson received more electoral and popular votes than any other candidate, but not the majority of 131 electoral votes needed to win the election. Since no candidate received the required majority of electoral votes, the presidential election was decided by the House of Representatives (see ""Contingent election"" below). Meanwhile, John C. Calhoun easily defeated his rivals in the race for the vice presidency, as the support of both the Adams and Jackson camps quickly gave him an unassailable lead over the other candidates. This means that 1824 marks the only election in U.S. history where only the vice presidential candidate had been successfully elected to an executive office by Electoral College. Despite Clay himself finishing last in the electoral college, his running-mate, Nathan Sanford actually finished second behind Calhoun in the vice presidential vote, mostly because nearly half of the electors pledged to Crawford voted for candidates other than his designated running-mate, Nathaniel Macon, with New York senator Martin Van Buren being the main beneficiary.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1039,Romantic music,how did orchestra change in the romantic period,"In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literary, artistic, and philosophical themes. Famous early Romantic composers include Beethoven (whose works span both this period and the preceding Classical period), Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Bellini, and Berlioz. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble. Also, public concerts became a key part of urban middle class society, in contrast to earlier periods, when concerts were mainly paid for by and performed for aristocrats. Famous composers from the second half of the century include Bruckner, Johann Strauss II, Brahms, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Dvořák, Verdi, and Wagner. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including Mahler, Richard Strauss, Puccini, and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex – and often much longer – musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include Saint-Saëns, Fauré, Rachmaninoff and Franck.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1057,Nil Darpan,who translated the play neel darpan into english,"James Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators. His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan (the original Bengali play was written by him) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860. Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861. Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton-Karr, Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission. Seton-Karr, sensing its importance, mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor, Grant.Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends. After the discussion, Seton-Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English. Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long. Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play. When the translation was complete, Seton-Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant's wish of a few copies. Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel, the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs.300. It was published in April or May 1861. Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor, Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading: ""on her Majesty's Service"".[5] The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters. It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo-Indian Press against the publisher and the translator. One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer- C. H. Manuel. The words mentioned in Long's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was ""plain but true"". This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements.

1058,Combustion,what must be present for a combustion reaction to occur,"Combustion /kəmˈbʌs.tʃən/ or burning[1] is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as smoke. Combustion in a fire produces a flame, and the heat produced can make combustion self-sustaining. Combustion is often a complicated sequence of elementary radical reactions. Solid fuels, such as wood and coal, first undergo endothermic pyrolysis to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies the heat required to produce more of them. Combustion is often hot enough that light in the form of either glowing or a flame is produced. A simple example can be seen in the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen into water vapor, a reaction commonly used to fuel rocket engines.

1110,Christmas,when was christmas first celebrated as a holiday,"Although the month and date of Jesus' birth are unknown, by the early-to-mid fourth century the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December 25,[23] a date that was later adopted in the East.[24][25] Today, most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, some Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar, the day after the Western Christian Church celebrates the Epiphany. This is not a disagreement over the date of Christmas as such, but rather a preference of which calendar should be used to determine the day that is December 25. Moreover, for Christians, the belief that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than the exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.[26][27][28][29]",NONE,early-to-mid fourth century,,,,,,,,,,,,

The song begins with a disappointed Devil arriving in Georgia, having stolen far fewer souls than expected, when he comes upon a fiddle-playing young man named Johnny. At that moment, Johnny happens to be playing his fiddle impressively ""hot."" Out of desperation, the Devil, who as it turns out also plays the fiddle, offers Johnny the wager which involves challenging the young man to a fiddle-playing contest. The Devil offers to give Johnny a golden fiddle if the young man plays better than he does; otherwise, the Devil will gain Johnny's soul. Although Johnny believes taking the Devil's bet might be a sin, he wagers his soul without fear, confidently boasting he is ""the best that's ever been.""",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Camille was originally recognized as the fifth strongest hurricane on record, but was dropped to the seventh strongest in 2014, with an estimated pressure at 905 mbars, tying it with Hurricanes Mitch, and Dean. Camille then was recategorized with a new pressure of 900 mbars. Currently, Mitch and Dean share intensities for the eighth strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905 mbar (hPa; 26.73 inHg).[26] Hurricane Maria is in tenth place for most intense Atlantic tropical cyclone, with a pressure as low as 908 mbar (hPa; 26.81 inHg).[28] In addition, the most intense Atlantic hurricane outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico is Hurricane Irma of 2017, with a pressure of 914 mbar (hPa; 27.0 inHg).[29]",NONE,914 mbar (hPa; 27.0 inHg),,,,,,,,,,,,
1124,Cooling tower,why does cooling water run through the condenser,"Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine.[2] Condensers use relatively cool water, via various means, to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines. This reduces the back pressure, which in turn reduces the steam consumption, and thus the fuel consumption, while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler-water.[3] However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water, without which they are impractical.[4][5] The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040â€“2069.[6] While water usage is not an issue with marine engines, it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1125,Chromosome,when does a cell have condensed visible chromosomes also known as sister chromatids,"Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division (where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form).[3] Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure (pictured to the right) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study.[4] In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during segregation.[5]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1126,Bat Masterson (TV series),who played bat masterson in the tv series,Bat Masterson is an American Western television series which showed a fictionalized account of the life of real-life marshal/gambler/dandy Bat Masterson.

A new corpus luteum develops with each menstrual cycle.[citation needed]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Winter Is Coming""
Tim Van Patten
David Benioff & D. B. Weiss
April 17, 2011 (2011-04-17)
2.22[2]


In the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, a soldier of the ancient Night's Watch order survives an attack by supernatural creatures known as the White Walkers, thought until now to be myth. He rushes to Castle Winterfell, which is ruled by Eddard ""Ned"" Stark, Warden of the North, who decapitates the soldier for deserting his post. In King's Landing, the capital, Jon Arryn, the ""Hand of the King"", dies under mysterious circumstances. King Robert Baratheon, Ned's longtime friend, travels to Winterfell, offering the position to him and also proposing marriage between his firstborn son Joffrey and Ned's older daughter Sansa. Ned's wife Catelyn receives a letter from her sister Lysa, Jon Arryn's widow, saying that she has escaped King's Landing and that Jon was murdered by the Lannisters, Queen Cersei's family. Catelyn burns the letter and tells Ned about it, believing that the Lannisters are plotting against Robert. Ned's 10-year-old son, Brandon, climbs a tower, where he witnesses Cersei having sex with her twin brother, Jaime, who then pushes him out the window from a presumably fatal height. Meanwhile across the narrow sea in Essos, the exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen makes a deal with the Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo, who marries Viserys' younger sister, Daenerys, in exchange for an army to conquer Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne.

2.20[3]


Having accepted his new role as the Hand of the King, Ned leaves Winterfell with his daughters Sansa and Arya, while Catelyn stays behind to tend to Bran. The unconscious Bran is attacked by an assassin, but his direwolf saves him. Catelyn decides to go to King's Landing to tell Ned about the attempt and suspected Lannister involvement. Jon Snow, Ned's illegitimate son, heads north to join the brotherhood of the Night's Watch, protectors of the Wall that keeps the White Walkers and the wildlings from entering civilized Westeros. Tyrion, Cersei's brother, decides to forgo the trip south with his family and instead accompanies Snow's entourage to the Wall. When Joffrey threatens Arya and her friend, Arya's direwolf defends her and escapes, provoking a conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters. To resolve the insult, Robert orders Ned to execute Sansa's direwolf. In Winterfell, Brandon awakens from unconsciousness. Meanwhile, Daenerys focuses her attention on learning how to please Drogo.

2.44[4]


Ned joins the King's Small Council at King's Landing, capital of the Seven Kingdoms, and learns just how poorly Westeros is being managed. Catelyn tries to covertly warn her husband, but is intercepted by an old friend, Councillor Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish. Bran learns he will never walk again. He does not remember the events leading to his fall. Jon struggles to adapt to life on the Wall, as he trains with a number of low-born recruits who are not impressed by his bloodline. Lord Commander Mormont asks Tyrion to plead with the King to send more men to the Night's Watch. Daenerys learns that she is pregnant, and begins to stand up to Viserys.

Tyrion shares saddle modifications for Bran that will allow the paraplegic boy to ride before heading south. Ned searches for clues to the unexplained death of his mentor and predecessor Jon Arryn and in the process uncovers King Robert's illegitimate son. Robert and his guests witness a tournament honoring Ned. Jon takes measures to protect Samwell Tarly, an awkward and friendless boy, from the abuse of the Night's Watchmen. A frustrated Viserys clashes with his newly empowered sister. Sansa dreams of life as a queen, while Arya envisions a far different future. At a chance encounter in a roadside tavern, Catelyn rallies her father's allies and has Tyrion arrested for conspiring to murder her son.

Ned refuses to participate in Robert's plan to assassinate the pregnant Daenerys Targaryen, and resigns as Robert's Hand, angering him. Catelyn and Tyrion (who she has taken as her prisoner) arrive at her sister Lysa's home in the Eyrie. News of Tyrion's capture reaches King's Landing where Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother, demands answers from Ned. A vengeful Jaime fights Ned until his man stabs Ned in the leg from behind, leaving him wounded as his forces leave the capital.

Robert reappoints Ned as Hand and tasks him with running affairs until he returns from hunting. Villagers from Riverrun arrive in the throne room with news of atrocities committed by raiders, who Ned deduces were led by Gregor Clegane, a Lannister retainer. Ned sentences Gregor to death and sends a message to Tywin Lannister, summoning him to a trial. Ned decides to send Sansa, (now reconciled with Joffrey), and Arya back to Winterfell. Ned finds out that Joffrey is not Robert's biological son. While out testing his new saddle, Bran is attacked by outlaws. Robb, Ned's oldest son, and Theon, the fostered son of a fallen rebel king, save him. In the Vale, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, which Lysa accepts. She chooses Ser Vardis and Tyrion asks for a champion. The mercenary Bronn volunteers, killing Vardis and thereby obtaining Tyrion's release. Meanwhile, Viserys becomes enraged with Drogo for not honoring his promise and threatens to kill Daenerys' unborn child. Drogo kills Viserys by pouring molten gold on his head.

In King's Landing, Ned tells Cersei he knows she is involved with Jaime and none of her children are Robert's. They soon learn that Robert has been critically wounded by a boar while hunting. A dying Robert names Ned as the ""Protector of the realm"" to rule until Joffrey reaches the legal age. Ned sends a message to Stannis, Robert's brother, intending to enthrone him since Robert has no true heirs. Ned tells Petyr Baelish about his plan and asks him to gain the loyalty of the City Watch, the only force capable of overpowering Lannister forces loyal to Cersei. After Robert's death, Ned, Baelish and the City Watch confront Cersei and Joffrey in the throne room, where Baelish and the City Watch betray Ned and attack his men. At the Wall, Ned's younger brother Benjen goes missing during a foray beyond the Wall. Snow and Tarly are picked as stewards, with Jon assigned to Lord Commander Mormont. The duo swear their loyalties to the Night's Watch. In Essos, Robert's assassin is captured before he can poison Daenerys. Drogo vows to conquer the Seven Kingdoms and give it to his son. He starts marching towards Westeros.

Arya manages to escape the Red Keep after her Braavosian sword master delays the guards sent to arrest her; Sansa is captured however. Robb hears the news and prepares the Northern armies to fight the Lannisters, leaving Bran behind to rule Winterfell. Lysa refuses to fight the Lannisters; and Catelyn leaves, joining Robb's camp. Tyrion and Bronn are surrounded by Shagga and his men. Tyrion convinces them to escort him to Tywin to repay them. They arrive at Tywin's camp, where the latter asks Shagga to help them in their confrontation with the Starks in exchange for payment. Joffrey appoints Tywin as the Hand. Sansa begs the former to show mercy upon Ned. Joffrey agrees if the latter recognizes his reign. At the Wall, some bodies affected by the White Walkers are found. In Essos, Drogo's soldiers begin attacking nearby settlements, enslaving locals in order to sell them and gain the money to buy the ships necessary to pass the Narrow Sea.

The Stark army arrives at the Twins castle; and Catelyn convinces Lord Frey to let them pass and assist them by agreeing for marriage of Robb and Arya to Frey's children in the future. Robb sacrifices 2000 soldiers in a confrontation with the Lannister army to capture Jaime. In a public hearing, Ned confesses to treason and publicly affirms Joffrey as rightful heir. However, rather than sentencing him to the Wall as had been negotiated, a vengeful Joffrey has him decapitated, while Cersei and other counselors object futilely. Sansa and Arya watch their father die: Sansa from the royal party and Arya from the crowd. At the Wall, Jeor Mormont gives his family sword to Jon in gratitude; Maester Aemon also reveals to Jon that Aemon is a Targaryen. In Essos, Drogo's wound becomes septic and his death imminent. Daenerys convinces a slave woman to use blood magic to save him. The woman tells everyone to leave the tent and stay outside until the spell is over. Daenerys begins labor, and Jorah brings her into the forbidden tent seeking aid.

The North secedes from the Seven Kingdoms and proclaims Robb as their king. With Jaime captured by the Starks and Robert's brothers challenging Joffrey's claim to the throne, Tywin appoints Tyrion as King's Hand. Jon plans to desert his post at the Wall to avenge Ned, but his friends convince him to stay and he instead joins a Night's Watch expedition to find Benjen beyond the Wall. Yoren, a Night's Watch recruiter, helps Arya escape King's Landing disguised as a boy while Joffrey plans to make Sansa his queen despite her father's execution. Daenerys learns that her unborn son is dead and Drogo has been left in a vegetative state due to the witch's treacherous magic. Daenerys ends Drogo's life and lights a funeral pyre. She burns the witch alive alongside Drogo's body and her three dragon eggs, and walks into the flames herself. When the embers die the following morning, Daenerys rises, unharmed, flanked by three newborn dragons. Jorah and other witnesses kneel before her.

In the 1960s, the past record of geomagnetic reversals was noticed by observing the magnetic stripe ""anomalies"" on the ocean floor.[13] This results in broadly evident ""stripes"" from which the past magnetic field polarity can be inferred by looking at the data gathered from simply towing a magnetometer on the sea surface or from an aircraft. The stripes on one side of the mid-ocean ridge were the mirror image of those on the other side. The seafloor must have originated on the Earth's great fiery welts, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise.

The concept arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by Eastman during a casual evening of brainstorming and bad television with Laird.[3] Using money from a tax refund, together with a loan from Eastman’s uncle, the young artists self-published a single-issue comic intended to parody four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s: Marvel Comics’ Daredevil and New Mutants, Dave Sim’s Cerebus, and Frank Miller’s Ronin.[4] The TMNT comic book series has been published in various incarnations by various comic book companies since 1984.",NONE,1984,,,,,,,,,,,,

To meet the challenges of global conflict in the Cold War period and to contain conflicts within the hemisphere, they adopted a system of collective security, the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, popularly known as the Rio Treaty, in 1947. The following year, at the Ninth International Conference of American States, headed by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall, twenty-one member states pledged to fight communism in the Americas, and transformed the Pan American Union into the Organization of American States (OAS).

Four of these players (including two active members of the 50 home run club)[8] have played for only one major league team. The New York Yankees are the only franchise to have five players reach the milestone while on their roster: Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Alex Rodriguez, and Aaron Judge. Ten players are also members of the 500 home run club[9] and two of them (Willie Mays and Rodriguez) are also members of the 3,000 hit club.[10] Ten players won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in the same year as their 50 home run season.[11] Mantle is the only player to have earned the Major League Triple Crown alongside achieving 50 home runs, leading both leagues in batting average, home runs and runs batted in (RBI).[12][13][14] Mantle and Maris—collectively known as the M&M Boys—are the only teammates to reach the 50 home run club in the same season, hitting a combined 115 home runs in 1961 and breaking the single-season record for home runs by a pair of teammates.[15][16] Albert Belle is the only player to amass 50 or more doubles in addition to attaining 50 home runs.[17][18] Prince Fielder, at 23 years and 139 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Bonds, at age 37, was the oldest.[19][20]",NONE,Mickey Mantle,Roger Maris,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the concept that mantle plumes are fixed relative to one another, and anchored at the core-mantle boundary, would provide a natural explanation for the time-progressive chains of older volcanoes seen extending out from some such hot spots, such as the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain.

Rachel Argyll falls to the floor, bleeding profusely from a wound to the back of her head caused by a whisky decanter. As her body is being carried off on a stretcher, one of her five adopted children, Jack, is fingerprinted and talks the crime over with his dad, Leo Argyll, at the police station. Jack is later beaten to death in prison and the family buries him. Eighteen months later, Leo Argyll is preparing to marry his secretary, Gwenda Vaughan. This sees the return of son Mickey to the house and the arrival of a strange visitor, Dr Arthur Calgary, who reveals that he gave a lift to Jack at the time that Rachel Argyll was murdered, thus proving belatedly Jack's innocence. The delay in coming forward is explained away by Calgary being a physicist who has been in the Arctic on a research project. Later, whilst Calgary is sleeping in his hotel room, Mickey Argyll goes to question him and warn him off. At the hotel, Philip Durrant, the husband of Rachel's eldest adopted daughter, joins Calgary for dinner to propose a plan to make money from Calgary's revelation by selling the story to the newspapers. Durrant, a former Royal Air Force pilot who was disabled in a car crash, is shown as an abusive husband and a morphine addict. His wife Mary Durrant is also nasty to Tina Argyll and tells Gwenda that she will never replace her mother.

Dr Calgary revisits Sunny Point and is spotted by Hester before Mickey forces him into a car and drives him to a railway station. He assaults Calgary and firmly puts him on a train and tells him to leave. Whilst in motion, Calgary gets the train to stop in the middle of nowhere so he can get off and go back. Over breakfast at Sunny Point, Phillip antagonises everyone and causes many arguments between the siblings. He points out that trying to hide the new found evidence from Calgary, would look suspicious to the police. Calgary later telephones the house with the housemaid, Kirsten, picking up the phone at the same time as Leo Argyll. Calgary informs Argyll that he is going to the police with Kirsten overhearing it all but saying nothing. Whilst Calgary is walking on the road, he is stopped by Bellamy Gould, Chief Constable and friend of Leo Argyll, who is driving a car. Gould questions Calgary's statement and seems to leave only to turn around and try to run Calgary down. Gould dies in trying, but Calgary survives. Calgary eventually gets a fair hearing form Leo Argyll and stays overnight at the house giving his version of events over dinner. The four remaining Argyll siblings meet later that night in the woods and argue about where they all were on the night of Rachel's murder and bicker in a display of sibling rivalry with Mary Durrant appearing as the most upset by events and how she feels the other children spoilt her relationship with Rachel. Near the end of the episode, Phillip Durrant is trying to leave the house when he hears footsteps behind him, he turns and says ""of course it's you!"". In the morning, Calgary reveals he wrote a detonation formula for the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this led him to go mad and be detained against his will at an asylum, not away at the Arctic, as he claimed in the first episode. On the night that Rachel died, he escaped and gave a lift to Jack. At breakfast, Calgary mentions that the shower in the Durrant's room has been going for some time. Leo Argyll and Calgary go to investigate and find Phillip Durrant dead on the floor of the shower with a hypodermic needle in his arm.

This episode runs over a very short time period but has flashbacks for all the characters and details their reasons for possibly being the killer of Rachel. Hester runs away from the house and when Rachel tracks her down, she drugs her and takes her to hospital where she instructs the doctor to terminate the pregnancy. Jack witnesses Mickey and Tina in a passionate embrace and uses this against Rachel. Later we see Rachel telling Tina that she is filth. When Rachel goes into Leo's study and discovers women's underwear on the floor, she goes to the very top floor of the house and catches Leo and Gwenda on the bed. She informs Gwenda that Leo has a habit of sleeping with the staff and that she is not the first. Gwenda retaliates in kind and Rachel smacks her across the face. Rachel tells Leo she is divorcing him and through the conversation, it is understood that the money is in her name and he will be penniless. When she leaves Leo's study, she is confronted by Mary who is upset that Rachel does not love her. Rachel tells her that she only adopted her because she was sad, and that it wasn't Mary's fault she could not stop her sadness. Jack witnesses this and is aghast, so he confronts his mother and she in turn tells him he is the son of Kirsten, the cook. Jack goes go see Kirsten and through another flashback, Jack is shown in the police station telling Leo that he knows that Leo is his father and that Kirsten is his mother. He tells Leo acidly that he will destroy him and ruin his life. Rachel is then shown being hit on the head with an Egyptian statuette by Leo and soon afterwards, Kirsten goes in to confront her about telling Jack of his parentage. Rachel dies in Kirsten's arms and the policeman, Gould, conspires with Leo to have Jack killed in prison. After Phillip is discovered dead, Leo has Calgary taken away to the asylum and Leo is confronted by his children and Kirsten who show him the statuette as the murder weapon, not the decanter that had Jack's fingerprints on it. Later, Gwenda and the four remaining children are shown on the dock by the lake dressed up for the wedding, but with police divers searching the lake. Gwenda is asking why Leo has killed himself. Later, Leo is shown waking up in the bunker underneath the house and pleading to be let out whilst Kirsten walks way smiling.

1288,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,who played the hobbits in the lord of the rings,"
Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins: a young hobbit who inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo. Wood was the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999.[12] Wood was a fan of the book, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[13] Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned,[14] including Jake Gyllenhaal.[15]
Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: an Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo. Sean Connery was approached for the role, but did not understand the plot,[13] while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script.[16] Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with X-Men.[14] He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films,[10] and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.[8]
Sean Astin as Samwise ""Sam"" Gamgee: a hobbit gardener and Frodo's best friend. Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam's relationship with Frodo.[8]
Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn II Elessar: a Dúnedain ranger, the descendant of Isildur, and heir to Gondor's throne. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production, but turned it down.[17] Nicolas Cage also received an offer, declining because of ""family obligations"",[18] while Vin Diesel, a fan of the book, auditioned for Aragorn. Stuart Townsend was cast in the role, before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young.[13] Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down after taking what he thought to be a similar role in Gladiator.[13] Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again.[17] Executive Producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.[8] Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop.[19] Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume[20] and carrying his ""hero"" sword around with him off-camera.[8]
Billy Boyd as Peregrin ""Pippin"" Took: a hobbit who travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.
Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck: a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[13]
John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: a dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell and a descendant of Durin's Folk. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, later portrayed Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy.[13] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually developed eczema around his eyes.[8]
Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf: a prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[13]
Sean Bean as Boromir: a prince of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed.[13]
Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of The Lord of the Rings, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[13] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in The Hobbit, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[21]
Liv Tyler as Arwen Undomiel: a beautiful half-elf princess of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.[13] Peter Jackson wanted to cast Uma Thurman as Arwen, but Thurman pulled out due to pregnancy, Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[22]
Cate Blanchett as Galadriel: the elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn. Peter Jackson wanted to cast Lucy Lawless as Galadriel, but she declined due to pregnancy.[23]
Christopher Lee as Saruman the White: the fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the palantír. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met J. R. R. Tolkien.[19] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[13]
Hugo Weaving as Elrond: the elven Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, ""To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.""[14]
Sala Baker as Sauron: the Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring's true master who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form. Originally hired as one of the several stunt performers for the film trilogy, Baker ended up landing the role. In addition, he went on to play several Orcs as well.
Andy Serkis as Gollum voice and motion capture: a wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned over centuries by the Ring.
David Weatherley as Barliman Butterbur, proprietor in Bree
Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz: the commander of Saruman's Orc forces;
Marton Csokas as Celeborn: the elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside his wife Galadriel;
Craig Parker as Haldir: the leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien;
Mark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil-galad, the last Elven-King of Noldor;

1289,Text messaging,when did text messaging become popular in the us,"Initial growth of text messaging[where?] was slow, with customers in 1995 sending on average only 0.4 message per GSM customer per month.[14] One factor in the slow take-up of SMS was that operators were slow to set up charging systems, especially for prepaid subscribers, and to eliminate billing fraud, which was possible by changing SMSC settings on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators.[citation needed] Over time, this issue was eliminated by switch-billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs to allow blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through it.[citation needed] SMS is available on a wide range of networks, including 3G networks. However, not all text-messaging systems use SMS; some notable alternate implementations of the concept include J-Phone's SkyMail and NTT Docomo's Short Mail, both in Japan. E-mail messaging from phones, as popularized by NTT Docomo's i-mode and the RIM BlackBerry, also typically use standard mail protocols such as SMTP over TCP/IP.[15] As of 2007[update] text messaging was the most widely used mobile data service, with 74% of all mobile phone users worldwide, or 2.4 billion out of 3.3 billion phone subscribers, at the end of 2007 being active users of the Short Message Service. In countries such as Finland, Sweden and Norway, over 85% of the population use SMS. The European average is about 80%, and North America is rapidly catching up with over 60% active users of SMS by end of 2008[update].[citation needed] The largest average usage of the service by mobile phone subscribers occurs in the Philippines, with an average of 27 texts sent per day per subscriber.[citation needed]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him.

Its major provision was enforcing racially separated educational facilities.[1] Even universities were made ""tribal"", and all but three missionary schools chose to close down when the government no longer would help support their schools. Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans.[2] In 1959, this type of education was extended to ""non white"" universities and colleges with the Extension of University Education Act, and the internationally prestigious University College of Fort Hare was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system.[3] It is often argued that the policy of Bantu (African) education was aimed to direct black or non-white youth to the unskilled labour market,[4] although Hendrik Verwoerd, at the time Minister of Native Affairs, claimed that the aim was to solve South Africa's ""ethnic problems"" by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic groups.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They petitioned the state legislature in Nashville, which denied their request to secede and sent Confederate troops under Felix Zollicoffer to occupy East Tennessee and prevent secession.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although, it is later revealed there is a sire bond between them. Sometime later whilst searching for the cure for vampirism, Jeremy is fed to the immortal Silas by Katherine. As a result, Damon used the sire bond to convince her to turn off her humanity, due to her incredible grief over losing her brother and the last remaining member of her family. Elena became ruthless without her emotions, going on killing sprees and being very hateful towards her friends. Towards the end of season four, Damon kills Matt in front of Elena to trigger her grief. After revealing that Matt had the Gilbert Ring on, Elena's humanity was switched on and her emotions were focused on hate towards Katherine for killing Jeremy.

The Duffer Brothers
July 15, 2016 (2016-07-15)


On November 6, 1983, in a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory in the town of Hawkins, Indiana, a scientist is attacked by an unseen creature. While bicycling home from a Dungeons & Dragons session with his friends, 12-year-old Will Byers encounters the creature and vanishes. The next day, a buzz-cut young girl wearing a hospital gown steals food from a local diner. The owner, Benny, takes pity on her and feeds her before calling social services. From a tattoo on her arm, he learns that her name is Eleven. A woman posing as a social worker arrives and murders Benny. Armed men search the diner for Eleven, but she escapes. Will's mother Joyce believes she hears Will's voice on a distorted phone call, but her phone short circuits. Will's friends Mike, Dustin, and Lucas search for Will in the woods and find Eleven.

The boys bring Eleven to Mike's house, where she sleeps in the basement. The next day, Mike nicknames her ""El"". She says that ""bad people"" are looking for her and refuses to meet Mike's parents. Scientists from the laboratory find a substance oozing from the walls of Joyce's home. At Mike's home, Eleven recognizes and points out Will in a photo. Dustin and Lucas want to inform Mike's parents about Eleven, but she uses psychokinesis to stop them. While searching for Will, Mr. Clarke, the boys' science teacher, discovers a scrap of a hospital gown outside the laboratory grounds. Nancy goes with her friend Barb to a party at her boyfriend Steve's house. Will's brother Jonathan investigates the woods where Will went missing. Hearing screaming, he runs to help but finds only Steve, Nancy, and their friends roughhousing around Steve's swimming pool. He secretly photographs them. Barb, left alone by the poolside, vanishes. Joyce receives another call from Will, hears music from his room, and sees something coming through the wall.

July 15, 2016 (2016-07-15)


Barb wakes up in an empty and decaying pool. She screams for Nancy and attempts to climb out but is dragged down by something unseen. Joyce strings Christmas lights around her home to talk to Will, who can turn them on and off. Hawkins Lab director Dr. Martin Brenner allows Hopper to view the lab's security camera footage. Hopper realizes it is fake. He and his deputies research Hawkins Lab, Brenner, and a woman named Terry Ives who claimed her daughter was taken by Brenner. Eleven has a flashback in which Brenner, whom she calls ""Papa,"" has her put in solitary confinement for refusing to telekinetically harm a cat. Nancy worries about Barb, who is missing. Steve and his friends discover Jonathan's photographs. They destroy them and his camera. Nancy recovers a photo of Barb by the poolside and returns to Steve's house to search for her. Nancy finds Barb's car and sees the creature in the woods. Joyce establishes a code with Will using the lights, which he uses to tell her that he is alive but unsafe. He tells Joyce to run as a creature begins to climb through her wall. Will's apparent body is discovered in the water at a quarry.

July 15, 2016 (2016-07-15)


Eleven proves to the boys that Will is still alive by making contact through Mike's walkie-talkie. Joyce goes to the morgue to view the body and refuses to believe it is Will. The boys give Eleven a makeover so they can sneak her into school. Joyce hears Will in her living room wall. Tearing away the wallpaper, she sees him behind a membrane. At school, Eleven uses Mr. Clarke's ham radio to channel Will talking to his mother. Joyce demolishes the wall with an axe but reveals only her front porch. Nancy discovers a figure behind Barb in Jonathan's photo. Jonathan realizes that the figure matches his mother's description of the creature: a humanoid figure with long arms and no face. Nancy tells the police about her missing friend and subsequently admits to her mother that she slept with Steve. When she tells Steve about the police, she is irritated that he cares only about not getting in trouble with his father. Hopper confronts the state trooper who found Will's body and beats him until he admits he was ordered to lie. Hopper goes to the morgue and finds that Will's supposed body is a dummy. He breaks into Hawkins laboratory.

Will's father Lonnie assures Joyce her experiences are hallucinations. Hopper discovers a portal in the basement of the lab but is knocked out by the lab's guards. He wakes at home and discovers a hidden microphone. Sheriff's deputies inform Hopper that Barb's car was found, but Hopper finds the state's involvement suspicious. The boys determine Will is trapped in an alternate dimension Eleven calls the ""Upside Down,"" and he is being pursued by a monster similar to a Demogorgon. After Will's funeral, science teacher Mr. Clarke tells the boys that a high-energy spacetime tear could create a passage between dimensions. Using their compasses, they search for a disruption in the Earth's electromagnetic field. Eleven remembers encountering the creature during a lab experiment, and afraid, she redirects the compasses. Lucas notices and confronts her. Mike defends her, he and Lucas fight, and Eleven telekinetically flings Lucas off Mike. While Dustin and Mike tend to the unconscious Lucas, Eleven disappears. In the woods, Nancy and Jonathan find a wounded deer. The creature drags the deer away, and Nancy follows the trail of blood to a portal to the Upside Down. She crawls through and discovers the creature feasting upon the deer. She snaps a twig and draws the creature's attention.

Jonathan pulls Nancy back through the portal and saves her from the monster. Later, Steve sees them together through her bedroom window and assumes they are dating. Nancy and Jonathan resolve to kill the monster and purchase supplies from an army surplus store. During a fist fight with Steve, Jonathan inadvertently assaults a police officer and is arrested. Joyce and Hopper track down Terry Ives, who is catatonic and tended by her sister Becky. Becky explains that Terry underwent Project MKUltra testing while unknowingly pregnant; she believed her daughter Jane was kidnapped by Brenner at birth. Joyce and Hopper conclude Eleven is likely Jane. Eleven shoplifts Eggo waffles. She recalls being asked to contact the monster and accidentally opening the portal to the Upside Down in the laboratory basement. While searching for Eleven, Mike and Dustin are ambushed by school bullies Troy and James. Troy holds Dustin at knifepoint and demands Mike make a suicidal jump into the lake where Will's body was discovered. Mike jumps but is levitated to safety by Eleven, who scares away the bullies. Lucas realizes agents from the laboratory are heading to Mike's house.

Lucas warns Mike via walkie-talkie that government agents are en route. Mike, Dustin, and Eleven flee. Eleven telekinetically flips a van that blocks their path, and the kids escape. Lucas reconciles with Mike and Eleven. Joyce and Hopper are called to the police station because of Jonathan's assault. Jonathan and Nancy reveal their knowledge of the monster to Joyce and Hopper. The group contacts Mike and his friends and they rendezvous. They ask Eleven to search for Will and Barb, but her earlier feats have left her too weak to find them. To amplify Eleven's powers, they break into the middle school and build a sensory-deprivation tank. Eleven finds Barb's corpse with a slug-like creature crawling out of her mouth. With Joyce's help, she finds Will alive, hiding in the Upside Down ""Castle Byers,"" his backyard fort. Hopper and Joyce break into Hawkins Laboratory but are apprehended by security guards. Nancy and Jonathan resolve to kill the monster and steal their hunting gear back from the police station. In the Upside Down, the monster breaks into the fort where Will is hiding.

""Chapter Eight: The Upside Down""
The Duffer Brothers
Story by : Paul Dichter
Teleplay by : The Duffer Brothers
July 15, 2016 (2016-07-15)


Hopper gives up Eleven's location so that he and Joyce can enter the Upside Down. They find Will unconscious in the Upside-Down town library. They pull a tendril out of his throat, perform CPR, and revive him. Nancy and Jonathan booby-trap the Byers' home, then cut their hands to attract the monster with their blood. Steve arrives, intending to apologize to Jonathan about their fight, but the monster attacks. The monster springs the trap but escapes back to the Upside Down. Eleven and the boys hide in the middle school. Mike asks Eleven to a school dance, the Snow Ball, and kisses her. The military storms the school to re-capture Eleven, but she kills them and collapses. As Brenner cradles her, the monster attacks, apparently killing him. The boys hide Eleven in a classroom. The monster corners them, but Eleven pins it against a wall. She says goodbye to Mike, disintegrates the monster, and vanishes. Will is hospitalized and reunited with his mother, brother, and friends. Hopper is reluctantly picked up by a black car. One month later, Nancy and Steve are back together, and both are friends with Jonathan. Hopper leaves Eggo waffles and other food in a box in the woods. Will coughs up a slug-like creature and has a vision of the world as the Upside Down, but he hides this from his family.

1337,Alan Turing,who cracked the enigma code in world war 2,"During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.[11][12] Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war,[13] but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives.[11]",NONE,Turing,,,,,,,,,,,,

1364,Los Angeles Lakers,when was the last time the los angeles lakers won a championship,"Led by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West, Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost each series to the Boston Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain to play center, and after losing in the Finals in 1969 and 1970, they won their sixth NBA title—and first in Los Angeles—in 1972, led by new head coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of West and Chamberlain, the team acquired another center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won multiple MVP awards, but was unable to make the Finals in the late 1970s. The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed ""Showtime"" due to their Magic Johnson-led fast break-offense, and won five championships in a 9-year span, including their first ever Finals championship against the Celtics in 1985. This team featured Hall of Famers in Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar, and James Worthy, and a Hall of Fame coach, Pat Riley. After Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson's retirement, the team struggled in the early 1990s before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996. Led by O'Neal, Bryant, and another Hall of Fame coach, Phil Jackson, Los Angeles won three consecutive titles between 2000 to 2002, securing the franchise its second ""three-peat"". After losing both the 2004 and 2008 NBA Finals, the Lakers won two more championships by defeating the Orlando Magic in 2009 and Boston in 2010.",NONE,2010,,,,,,,,,,,,

1376,Ring finger,which is the ring finger for male in india,"Rings are not traditional in an Indian wedding. However, in modern society it is becoming a practice to wear rings for engagements and not for actual marriage.

Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail, which caused disagreements with Eastwood, not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman's part in regards to their emerging relationship.[10] One evening, Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene, but while he was absent, Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away, leaving before Kaufman had returned.[11] Soon after, filming moved to Kanab, Utah. On October 24, 1975, Kaufman was fired at Eastwood's command by producer Bob Daley.[12] The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives, since the director had already worked hard on the film, including completing all of the pre-production.[12] Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down, but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine, reported to be around $60,000 for the violation.[12] This resulted in the Director's Guild passing new legislation, known as 'the Eastwood Rule', which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself.[12] From then on, the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second-in-command, but with Kaufman's planning already in place, the team were able to finish making the film efficiently.",NONE,Lake Powell,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average lifespan of a species is 1–10 million years,[23] although this varies widely between taxa. There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. ""Just as each species is unique"", write Beverly and Stephen C. Stearns, ""so is each extinction ... the causes for each are varied—some subtle and complex, others obvious and simple"".[24] Most simply, any species that cannot survive and reproduce in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when toxic pollution renders its entire habitat unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors.

4 time signature at a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range spawns from the low note B♭3 to the high note E♭5, while the music follows the chord progression of B♭–Cm–Gm–E♭.[8] The song shares the theme of empowerment with Perry's single ""Firework"".[9][10] Perry described the track as a song speaking about standing up for oneself.[11]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New England Patriots head coach Ron Meyer, by contrast, later stated that the team, led by owner Billy Sullivan, excluded the coaching staff from any personnel-related decisions, even prohibiting him from reading scouting reports.

1462,Whigs (British political party),who were the whigs and what did they stand for,"The Whigs were a political faction and then a political party in the parliaments of England, Scotland, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Between the 1680s and 1850s, they contested power with their rivals, the Tories. The Whigs' origin lay in constitutional monarchism and opposition to absolute monarchy. The Whigs played a central role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and were the standing enemies of the Stuart kings and pretenders, who were Roman Catholic. The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715 and remained totally dominant until King George III, coming to the throne in 1760, allowed Tories back in. The ""Whig Supremacy"" (1715–1760) was enabled by the Hanoverian succession of George I in 1714 and the failed Jacobite rising of 1715 by Tory rebels. The Whigs thoroughly purged the Tories from all major positions in government, the army, the Church of England, the legal profession and local offices. The Party's hold on power was so strong and durable, historians call the period from roughly 1714 to 1783 the age of the ""Whig Oligarchy"".[4] The first great leader of the Whigs was Robert Walpole, who maintained control of the government through the period 1721–1742 and whose protégé Henry Pelham led from 1743 to 1754.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California.[1] The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.[2] The sudden influx of immigration and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation. By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party.",NONE,James W. Marshall,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is usually related to ABO blood group incompatibility - the most severe of which often involves group A red cells being given to a patient with group O type blood. Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood, facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade. The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Jaundice and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may also occur. The most common cause is clerical error (i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the patient).",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1540,Federalism,where in the constitution is the concept of federalism established,"Because the states were preexisting political entities, the U.S. Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to the federal government. The federal government has certain express powers (also called enumerated powers) which are powers spelled out in the Constitution, including the right to levy taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. In addition, the Necessary and Proper Clause gives the federal government the implied power to pass any law ""necessary and proper"" for the execution of its express powers. Other powers—the reserved powers—are reserved to the people or the states.[21] The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), amendments to the Constitution following the Civil War, and by some later amendments—as well as the overall claim of the Civil War, that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, ""I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities"". The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new village.

1547,Evolution of the eye,what is the first step in the evolution of the eye,"The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called ""eyespots"". Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They are insufficient for vision, as they cannot distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from. Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups, and are common among unicellular organisms, including euglena. The euglena's eyespot, called a stigma, is located at its anterior end. It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals. Together with the leading flagellum, the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light, often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis,[22] and to predict day and night, the primary function of circadian rhythms. Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation.[citation needed]",NONE,photoreceptor proteins that sense light,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, should not be confused with lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode.[104][105] Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.",NONE,lithium,,,,,,,,,,,,

The next day, October 3, Duncan again reported feeling abdominal pain. That evening, the hospital contacted Chimerix, a biotechnology company developing Brincidofovir to combat the disease.

Meredith is relatively unscathed, while the rest have serious injuries: the pilot, Jerry (James LeGros), has a major spine injury, and Yang dislocates her arm. Robbins' femur is broken and sticking through the skin, Sloan has serious internal injuries; though initially adrenaline keeps him on his feet. Shepherd is sucked out the side of the plane and awakens alone in the wood; his mangled hand having been pushed through the door of the plane. However, none are in as bad shape as Lexie, who is crushed under a piece of the plane. While Meredith searches for Shepherd, Yang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie.

1575,Harper Valley PTA (film),who played in the movie harper valley pta,"
Barbara Eden as Stella Johnson, a widowed cosmetics salesperson with a young daughter, whose joie de vivre, her principles, and her individuality anger most of the powerful people in town and on the Parent Teachers Association board. She inevitably becomes PTA president after embarrassing Flora, the snobby former President and her equally snobby friends.
Ronny Cox as Willis ""Will"" Newton, a wealthy member of the PTA who doesn't agree with Flora and her snobby allies and is in love with Stella. He and Stella get married at the end of the movie.
Nanette Fabray as Alice Finley, Stella's best friend and co-conspirator against the snobs of Harper Valley. She owns and operates the La Moderne Beauty Shop.
Louis Nye as Kirby Baker, a local real estate agent who is allied with Flora and her friends. Notorious for being a lecherous playboy and infamous for impregnating his secretaries, one of whom, Gladys Wilmot, left town to see an abortionist in Cincinnati. As part of a plan to discredit Stella, he tries to foreclose on Stella's house, which infuriates her. He then gets arrested and jailed for attacking Myrna Wong, a friend of Stella's, who rebuffs his advances, throwing him by use of martial arts and destroying the office.
John Fiedler as Bobby Taylor, a man on the PTA who lusts after Stella. Overly dominated by his wife, Holly. Although open to allow Stella to speak, he is not above having a fellow PTA board member kidnapped to commit election fraud. He was arrested for indecent exposure after being set up by Stella.
Ron Masak as Herbie Maddox, the head bartender at Kelly's bar, and Stella's ally against Flora and her friends. He has a crush on Stella, and is one of her friends.
Clint Howard as Corley, a young delivery person, who works for the local florist shop, who brings Stella flowers from Will.
Susan Swift as Dee Johnson, Stella's 14-year-old daughter, who is threatened with expulsion from school if her mother doesn't conform to the way the PTA wants her to behave. She has a hand in assisting her mother and Alice with one of their revenge schemes. She loses her braces, gets a makeover, and ends up with a boyfriend, Carlyle.
Pat Paulsen as Otis Harper, the descendant of the founding family of Harper Valley. A PTA member who is allied with Flora and her friends. Has a tendency to drink all the time, which annoys his wife, Bertha. He had a stampede of elephants, painted pink, stormed through his house, destroying it.
Amzie Strickland as Shirley Thompson, a member of the PTA board who tends to drink a lot of gin. Though she is allied with Flora and her friends, she is one of four PTA members (Will, Skeeter and Holly Taylor are the others) who are spared any retribution from Stella. She was seen as the most sympathetic of the board, as she tended to be more manipulated as opposed to being manipulative. It was never revealed whether or not she retained her seat on the PTA, but it is presumed that she became more sympathetic towards Stella as she was seen waving goodbye at Olive as she was being arrested.
Bob Hastings as Skeeter Duggan, a member of the PTA board, and the town's Notary public who is sympathetic to Stella. He is kidnapped by Dutch and Tex at Flora Simpson Reilly's orders.
Audrey Christie as Flora Simpson-Reilly, The movie's main antagonist. She is the pompous and extremely snobbish president of the PTA board who thoroughly despises Stella (who defeats her for president at the end of the movie) and all she stands for. So desperate is she to retain her power and prestige in the community that she has a fellow member of the PTA (Skeeter Duggan) kidnapped so she and her allies can commit election fraud. She is embarrassed when her permanent set is destroyed by a hair depilatory at the beauty salon.
Molly Dodd as Olive Glover, the recording secretary of the PTA who is a gambling addict. Clearly the most corrupt and most vindictive member of the PTA board, she is eventually arrested for embezzlement after having a load of hay and horse manure dumped on top of her. She is the one who initially angers Stella by sending her the letter denouncing her, and tries to get Dee's friend, Mavis, arrested for embezzlement.
Fay DeWitt as Willamae Jones, a snide biology teacher at the junior high school who is also a member of the PTA. She makes no secret of the fact that she favors the Reilly twins, due to the connections between her and Flora. Notorious for being a nymphomaniac (though she hides it under a prim-and-proper faÃ§ade), she is caught in flagrante delicto with Barney Crunk, the town's mailman, on film.
DeVera Marcus as Holly Taylor, Bobby's obviously overbearing wife, who tends to drink a lot when Bobby is out of town, and doesn't approve of Bobby's lusting, or of anything else he does (this is different from the character in the song, who ""seems to use a lot of ice whenever [her husband]'s away"", implying adultery with the iceman). However, despite her ties to Flora and her scheming friends, she, like Shirley Thompson, is spared any retribution from Stella, due to Stella refusing to date Bobby.
Louise Foley as Mavis, Dee Johnson's best friend, who is nearly framed for a crime she did not commit by the vindictive Olive Glover.
Brian Cook as Carlyle, a popular track star who chooses Dee, after she gets a makeover, and angers Bettina Reilly in the process.
Laura Teige as Bettina Reilly, One of Flora's twin granddaughters, who wants to be with Carlyle, and is jealous when he chooses Dee over her. She tends to be as snotty as her grandmother.
Jan Teige as Edwina Reilly, Bettina's twin sister, who is just as snotty as her.
Irene Yah-Ling Sun as Myrna Wong, a friend of Stella's who is a judo expert; she is assaulted by Kirby Baker (after leading him on; she destroys him and his office in retaliation) and has him sent to jail for assault.
Tobias Anderson as ""Cranky"" Barney Crunk, the town's nosy mailman who had the bad habit of peeking in everyone's mail. He is caught in flagrante delicto on film with Willamae Jones.
Royce D. Applegate as Dutch, one of two kidnappers who abduct Skeeter Duggan at Flora Simpson-Reilly's orders.
J. J. Barry as Tex, the mastermind of the kidnap plot to get Skeeter Duggan out of the way so Flora Simpson-Reilly and her friends could commit election fraud. He and his accomplice Dutch are arrested and the two of them rat out Flora and her friends on their scheme.
Pitt Herbert as Henry Reilly, Flora's overly dominated husband and grandfather to Edwina and Bettina. Henry is wealthy, but is very weak-willed and is known for acquiescing to his wife's schemes.
Arlen Stuart as Bertha Harper, wife of Otis Harper, who gets annoyed by her husband's continual drinking. She is terrified when her house is destroyed by pink-painted elephants.

1581,Jeep,what type of car is a jeep considered,"Prior to 1940 the term ""jeep"" had been used as U.S. Army slang for new recruits or vehicles,[8][9] but the World War II ""jeep"" that went into production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military 4x4, arguably making them the oldest four-wheel drive mass-production vehicles now known as SUVs.[10] The Jeep became the primary light 4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Army and the Allies during World War II, as well as the postwar period. The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war.

1609,United Kingdom corporation tax,what is the corporate tax rate in great britain,"Originally introduced as a classical tax system, in which companies were subject to tax on their profits and companies' shareholders were also liable to income tax on the dividends that they received, the first major amendment to corporation tax saw it move to a dividend imputation system in 1973, under which an individual receiving a dividend became entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid by the company paying the dividend. The classical system was reintroduced in 1999, with the abolition of advance corporation tax and of repayable dividend tax credits. Another change saw the single main rate of tax split into three.

1660,Brain,where does the brain get its energy from,"Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats.[74] Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons.[73] Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%.[75] The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI,[76] and NIRS.[77] The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar),[73] but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic[78] and heptanoic[79] acids), lactate,[80] acetate,[81] and possibly amino acids.[82]",NONE,"most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar),[73] but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic[78] and heptanoic[79] acids), lactate,[80] acetate,[81] and possibly amino acids",,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe.[2] Over time, especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe.",NONE,April 1917,,,,,,,,,,,,

1697,Compromise of 1877,who got what in the compromise of 1877,"The Compromise of 1877 was an informal, unwritten deal that settled the intensely disputed 1876 U.S. presidential election. It resulted in the United States federal government pulling the last troops out of the South, and formally ended the Reconstruction Era. Through the Compromise, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was awarded the White House over Democrat Samuel J. Tilden on the understanding that Hayes would remove the federal troops whose support was essential for the survival of Republican state governments in South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. The compromise involved Democrats who controlled the House of Representatives allowing the decision of the Electoral Commission to take effect. The outgoing president, Republican Ulysses S. Grant, removed the soldiers from Florida. As president, Hayes removed the remaining troops from South Carolina and Louisiana. As soon as the troops left, many white Republicans also left, and the ""Redeemer"" Democrats took control. They already dominated other state governments in the South. What was exactly agreed is somewhat contested as the documentation is insufficient.[1]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stella invites Bloom to attend Alfea, a school for fairies, to fully master her new powers. Knut returns with more ghouls and a troll, launching a surprise attack at Bloom's home.

While the Winx are on kitchen duty, Stella is invited on a date with Prince Sky (Brandon) at the brand-new Black Lagoon restaurant and also asks for help on picking out an outfit. While selecting her attire, Stella decides not to wear the ring of Solaria and gives it to Bloom for safekeeping (believing she won't need her magic powers). The next morning, Stella starts acting completely different, becoming irritable and refusing to say antything about last night. During classes, Bloom notices that Stella is absent and goes back to their dorm to check, only to find Stella has torn the room apart! An enraged Stella begins asks Bloom where her ring is, and eventually blasts her when she doesn't say. Stella then suddenly vanishes, leaving the other four to find Prince Sky at Redfountain for information. To their shock, Sky says he worked out all night and he never wrote the invitation. The Winx then decide to find the Black Lagoon, only it doesn't show up on Tecna's map, and no one in the city seems to know where it is. Just as Musa is ready to quit, a strange man gives them the exact location. The girls find a beautiful restaurant on the edge of town, though Flora finds it strange how the gorgeous tree feels dead. She quickly reveals that an illusion has been cast; revealing a run-down shack. The Winx venture inside and find Stella who begins attacking them! The girls transform, and quickly learn that the entire date was a plot by the Trix. They sent the fake invitation and kidnapped her to get her ring of Solaria! However, when she didn't wear it, they sent Darcy disguised as Stella back to Alfea to find it. The Trix also reveal the real Stella trapped in magic energy rings and force Bloom into an ultimatum; hand over the ring or Icy will kill Stella. In the end, Bloom decides Stella is more important, transforms out of fairy form and gives them the ring, while also beginning her role as the unofficial leader.

After returning to Alfea, Bloom researches the Ring of Solaria, hoping to find out what made the Trix go to such lengths to get it. Meanwhile, the Trix use a spell on the ring, hoping to access an extremely powerful magic known as the Dragon Flame, only to have their spell blow up in their faces as the ring proves negative! An infuriated Icy throws the ring away and plans to begin the search all over again. Back at Alfea, Bloom learns more on the ring of Solaria, but also learns about the Dragon Flame. Bloom then turns to Faragonda for answers, who tells her that the Dragon Flame was the energy of the Great Dragon, who created the magical universe and later rested on the planet Domino. That night, the Winx plan to infiltrate Cloud Tower to retrieve Stella's ring (since she can't transform without it). Using the same secret tunnel the Trix used earlier, the girls sneak into Cloudtower without a hitch while the Trix are out. After searching their room, Stella finds her ring, but the tunnel doesn't reopen and the Winx are forced to find the main exit without getting caught. While exploring, the Winx stumble upon Cloudtower's archive which contains history on every person in the Magic dimension. A curious Bloom spots a book with her name on it and tries to read more on her past, but quickly regrets it when it turns into a trap that alerts Headmistress Griffin! The Winx try to make a hasty escape, but Griffin sends Bako monsters to scare them out! After using their magic to fight the monsters, the Winx are led to a dead end. In a panic to destroy the last monster, Stella accidentally sets the room on fire! As the Winx begin to suffocate, a mysterious voice guides Bloom to an exit, allowing them to leave Cloudtower. Though the ring was recovered, the Winx are busted since Griffin already called Faragonda hours ago. As punishment, Faragonda temporarily extracts all their powers.

The Winx have lost all their magic as punishment for sneaking into Cloudtower, but to make matters worse, Griselda tasks them with cleaning the entire school without their magic (or technology, much to Tecna's dismay) while the rest of the students and faculty go to a concert. Problems continue as Tecna struggles with no gadgets to help her, causing her to wear a bucket on her head and attempt to use a broom, while Musa, Stella and Bloom have a water fight, wasting their time, energy and supplies. In order to make the punishment lighter, the girls secretly invite the boys from Redfountain over after everyone has left, claiming to be throwing an all-night party. Meanwhile, the Trix use the opportunity to sneak into a near-empty Alfea to find the real source of the Dragon Flame. The boys arrive and instead learn they'll be working as janitors, though they still play music as they work. Soon after, the Trix teleport to Alfea and summon the vacuums to guide them towards the Dragon Flame, while distracting the gang by summoning a monster. The Winx and specialists quickly meet their distraction, and while the boys try to fight with their weapons, their quickly knocked aside. The Winx, despite having no magic, manage to outsmart the beast by using floor cleaner. Unable to find the Dragon Flame, the Trix depart to Cloudtower, unseen by anyone while the Specialists head back to Redfountain. The next morning, Faragonda sees the damage and hears the story from the Winx and as a reward for defeating an adversary using only wits and resourcefulness, the Winx's powers are returned to them.

Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
Continued to take personal inventory, and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.
Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

During their bye, the Eagles signed former Giants offensive tackle Will Beatty and former Saints linebacker Dannell Ellerbe to not only add depth but also players with Super Bowl experiences. Coming off of the bye week, the Philadelphia Eagles entered a Sunday night showdown with the defending NFC East champion Dallas Cowboys. The Eagles came out sluggish and trailed 9–7 at the half. The team exploded in the second half though, rattling off 30 unanswered points to soundly defeat their rival by a final score of 37–9. The Eagles were rolling on a nine-game winning streak after a huge blowout win over the Chicago Bears.[28] The Eagles traveled to Seattle in Week 13 in a huge Sunday Night showdown against Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks. The Eagles struggled throughout the whole game, blowing many scoring opportunities and allowing Wilson to throw 3 touchdowns. The Eagles lost 24–10, ending their win streak. However, the Eagles bounced back in Week 14 win over the Los Angeles Rams in a tough 43–35 win. However, Carson Wentz left the game in the third quarter with a knee injury. It was later found out that Wentz tore his ACL, ending his MVP caliber season. Backup Nick Foles would once again take over as starting quarterback. In Foles's first start against the New York Giants, he would lead them back from a 20–7 deficit and score 4 touchdowns and win the game 34–29. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys, and threw a touchdown and 2 interceptions in that span. Despite this, the Eagles finished 13–3 and secured the top seed in the NFC. The Eagles opened as the underdogs, the first time in history that a No. 1 seed has opened up the postseason as an underdog. Despite this, Foles would lead the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15–10. In the next game Foles and the Eagles annihilated the Minnesota Vikings 38–7 in the NFC Championship nicknamed the Minneapolis Massacre, mocking the Minneapolis Miracle from their previous playoff victory. Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and 3 touchdowns including an impressive flea flicker touchdown pass.

It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form.[8] Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called plumbago (Latin for ""lead ore"").[9][10] Because the pencil core is still referred to as ""lead"", or a ""lead"", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead,[11] and the black core of pencils is still referred to as lead, even though it never contained the element lead.[12][13][14][15][16][17] The words for pencil in German (bleistift), Irish (peann luaidhe), Arabic (قلم رصاص qalam raṣāṣ), and some other languages literally mean lead pen.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts.[4] In contrast prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.",NONE,inside the cell nucleus,"in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts",,,,,,,,,,,

Fiona's curse alters Storybrooke, institutionalizing Emma and leaving only Henry and Gold ""awake,"" while sending Emma's other allies to their home realms. The Final Battle begins over Emma's belief; if she stops believing in the realms of story, they will be consumed by the Darkness and cease to exist. If all the realms are destroyed, Fiona would gain unchecked powers and be able to break the Laws of Magic at will. In the Enchanted Forest, the banished characters gather at Regina's castle; David and Hook obtain a magic bean and the Evil Queen sacrifices herself, holding off the Darkness to delay the group's destruction. Fiona convinces Emma to destroy the book, but Henry hand-draws one that restores her belief in time to save everyone in the castle. Gold kills Fiona, who had hidden Belle and turned her into a coward; this breaks the Curse, which restores everyone's memories and reunites them in Storybrooke. However, Gideon is still under orders to kill Emma. Gold attempts to free Gideon's heart; however, a spell cast by the Black Fairy prevents him from doing so. Emma lays down her sword, allowing Gideon to impale her; this releases Emma's light magic and ends the battle. With both Gold and Emma having chosen good, Gideon is returned to infancy and the realms are restored, and those who died in the crisis are revived. The characters embark on their ""happy beginnings."" Many years later in the New Enchanted Forest[82], an adult Henry vanishes while defending his daughter Lucy from an unidentified entity. Guided by Tiger Lily, Lucy travels to Seattle, where Henry no longer remembers her.

The DNA structure of the cell is made up of two helixes made up of sugar and phosphate held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of opposite strands. The sugar and the phosphate in each strand are joined together by stronger phosphodiester covalent bonds. The DNA is ""unzipped"" (disruption of hydrogen bonds between different single strands) by the enzyme helicase, leaving the single nucleotide chain open to be copied. RNA polymerase reads the DNA strand from the 3-prime (3') end to the 5-prime (5') end, while it synthesizes a single strand of messenger RNA in the 5'-to-3' direction. The general RNA structure is very similar to the DNA structure, but in RNA the nucleotide uracil takes the place that thymine occupies in DNA. The single strand of mRNA leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores, and migrates into the cytoplasm.",NONE,in the cell nucleus,,,,,,,,,,,,

DiCaprio reflected, ""Scenes that we thought would take three days took an afternoon"".[19] Filming ran from April 25–30 in Park Avenue, just outside the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Production moved to Orange, New Jersey and returned to Brooklyn for bank and courthouse scenes. Shooting also took place at the TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport.[20] Quebec City was chosen for its European character and French feel.

1831,Minimum wage in the United States,when was the minimum wage established in the united states,"In 1910, in conjunction with advocacy work led by Florence Kelley of the National Consumer League, the Womenâ€™s Trade Union League (WTLU) of Massachusetts under the leadership of Elizabeth Evans took up the cause of minimum wage legislation in Massachusetts. Over the next two years, a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state.[25] In 1912, Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation, which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children. Within eight years, at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws, with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women's voluntary associations and organized labor.[26][27] The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws. Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon, which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not.[27] However, the Court did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws, considering the latter as interfering with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees.[26]:518",NONE,1912,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such notices of sale are often found in the local newspapers. Once the form has been filed, the creditor establishes a relative priority with other creditors of the debtor.[1] This process is also called ""perfecting the security interest"" in the property, and this type of loan is a secured loan.[2] A financing statement may also be filed in the real estate records by a lessor of fixtures to establish the priority of the lessor's rights against a holder of a mortgage or other lien on the real property.

The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determine the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 °C (59 °F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length.

In 1929, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first union to demand a five-day workweek and receive it. After that, the rest of the United States slowly followed, but it was not until 1940, when a provision of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act mandating a maximum 40-hour workweek went into effect, that the two-day weekend was adopted nationwide.[9]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1904,The Man in the High Castle,what do the films mean in high castle,"There are several major additional characters introduced by the television series and numerous narrative details and the plotline differ radically from the source novel. For example, the planned Nazi pre-emptive nuclear strike on Japan, ""Operation Dandelion,"" is apparently being prevented only by Hitler's personal refusal to authorise it, leading Heydrich and the faction demanding pre-emptive war to plot the FÃ¼hrer's assassination. In addition, Hawthorne Abendsen does not appear in the first season of the television version and The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is a series of newsreel films depicting multiple alternative realities rather than a novel (although this idea may actually be borrowed from Dick's later novel Valis which features a mysterious film depicting yet another dystopian alternative history of the USA). As of the Season 1 finale, these films are being tracked down by SS agents like Blake for dispatch to Hitler for an as-yet-unknown purpose.",NONE,The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is a series of newsreel films depicting multiple alternative realities,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adam Osborne founded Osborne Computer and formed the Osborne 1 in 1981. The Osborne 1 had a five-inch screen, incorporating a modem port, two 5 1/4 floppy drives, a big collection of bundled software applications, and a battery pack. The computer company was a failure and did not last for very long. Although it was large and heavy compared to today's laptops, with a tiny 5"" CRT monitor, it had a near-revolutionary impact on business, as professionals were able to take their computer and data with them for the first time. This and other ""luggables"" were inspired by what was probably the first portable computer, the Xerox NoteTaker. The Osborne was about the size of a portable sewing machine, and could be carried on commercial aircraft. The Osborne 1 weighed close to 11Â kg and was priced at $1795.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1926,American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct,states that have adopted the model rules of professional conduct,"The ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, created by the American Bar Association (ABA), are a set of rules that prescribe baseline standards of legal ethics and professional responsibility for lawyers in the United States. They were promulgated by the ABA House of Delegates upon the recommendation of the Kutak Commission in 1983. The rules are merely recommendations, or models, (hence the name ""Model Rules"") and are not themselves binding. However, having a common set of Model Rules facilitates a common discourse on legal ethics, and simplifies professional responsibility training as well as the day-to-day application of such rules. As of 2015[update], 49 states and four territories have adopted the rules in whole or in part, of which the most recent to do so was the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in March 2015.

1927,United States two-dollar bill,when were 2 dollar bills stopped being made,"The United States two-dollar bill ($2) is a current denomination of U.S. currency. The third U.S. President (1801â€“09), Thomas Jefferson, is featured on the obverse of the note. The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull. Throughout the $2 bill's pre-1929 life as a large-sized note, it was issued as a United States Note, National Bank Note, silver certificate, Treasury or ""Coin"" Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note. When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note. Production went on until 1966, when the series was discontinued. Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. Two-dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand. This comparative scarcity in circulation, coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation, has also inspired urban legends and occasionally has created problems for people trying to use the bill to make purchases.",NONE,current denomination of U.S. currency,,,,,,,,,,,,

The song was written by Kygo, Gomez, Andrew Watt, Brian Lee and Ali Tamposi. It was produced by Kygo, Watt, Ben Rice and Louis Bell. A dance-pop, electropop and tropical house song, ""It Ain't Me"" comprises an acoustic guitar line, and a build-drop arrangement in its chorus featuring pulsing piano notes, bass, synthesizers, finger-snap claps and pan flute melodies. Gomez sings the track in a husky tone, while in the chorus her vocals are reduced to recurring syllables.

""Past, Present, or Future""[m 1]
Lamborghini Aventador S, Honda NSX, Rimac Concept One
David Hasselhoff, Ricky Wilson
8 December 2017 (2017-12-08)


The tent is now in the Cotswolds and will remain there for the duration of the series. To determine whether the past, present, or future of motoring is best, the presenters visit Switzerland with Clarkson in a petrol powered Lamborghini Aventador S representing the past, May in a hybrid powered Honda NSX representing the present, and Hammond in an all-electric Rimac Concept One representing the future. After starting at the top of the Gotthard Pass,[46] Hammond brings the trio to a stay at the Park Weggis (de) health retreat and visit the Swiss Museum of Transport and other museums in Lucerne close to a charging station for the Rimac car.[46] May and Clarkson reject this and go to a hill climbing race at Hemberg instead. As Clarkson cannot fit into the Aventador whilst wearing a mandatory racing helmet, Clarkson sends a Lamborghini test driver in his place, thus setting the fastest time of all three. Hammond crashes after completing the course, destroying the Rimac in a fire. Footage taken from YouTube shows the wreckage being extinguished and Hammond being airlifted by the Swiss Air-Rescue (REGA) to hospital. The presenters discuss some inapropriate new features within cars on Conversation Street. Celebrity Brain Crash is replaced by Celebrity Face Off, in which Ricky Wilson beats David Hasselhoff to determine who the ""fastest former talent show host"" is.

15 December 2017 (2017-12-15)


The presenters race from Central Park in Manhattan, New York City, to an observation tower overlooking the Niagara Falls. Clarkson drives the new Ford GT whilst May and Hammond (on crutches) use public transport, taking the New York City Subway, AirTrain JFK, a JetBlue Embraer E190 flight, plus two Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority buses. Despite Hammond and May's flight arriving 15 minutes early, Clarkson narrowly wins the race. For Conversation Street the presenters discuss sponsorship ideas. Clarkson reviews the Mercedes AMG GT R, after which new test driver, Abbie Eaton, takes it for a timed lap around the Eboladrome. In ""Celebrity Face Off"", Kevin Pietersen of South Africa beats Brian Wilson of the U.S. as the ""fastest person who makes a living throwing and hitting and catching small balls"".

22 December 2017 (2017-12-22)


The presenters begin with Christmas tree lights made from vehicle parts and, Starting with Scalextric, they exchange humorous and inappropriate Christmas gifts in Conversation Street. May travels to Majorca to race a Kia Stinger GT against a pair of longboard riders along a mountain road, with May winning the race despite him racing uphill and the riders downhill. Hammond and May attempt to relieve lunchtime boredom by inventing ""lunchtime office car park racing"" at Houghton Hall business park in the Luton/Dunstable Urban Area. After brief interviews in which both share their own ownership of a Tesla Model S, Hugh Bonneville, representing the UK, and Casey Anderson, representing the United States, compete during ""Celebrity Face Off"" as the ""fastest person who lives with a bear"", with Anderson winning by setting the faster lap time. Clarkson experiments with the jet set lifestyle, starting in the morning from the Da Vinci super-yacht moored in Saint-Tropez and then driving a Bugatti Chiron to L'Alpe De Venosc France for skiing at lunchtime, stopping briefly for a drag race against a BMW M4 at Gap–Tallard Airport to give viewers a perspective on how fast the Chiron is. After leaving the Alps, Clarkson then pays an homage to the 1976 film C'était un rendez-vous, by speeding across Turin and reaching the Piazza Carignano (it) in 9 minutes.

McLaren 720S, Audi TT RS, Ariel Nomad
Michael Ball, Alfie Boe, Silvija Jurin[52][55]
29 December 2017 (2017-12-29)


The presenters begin by having a year-ending awards ceremony in Conversation Street. Hammond heads to the Eboladrome to test the McLaren 720S after which Eaton sets a lap time. Since The Grand Tour has been criticised for being too ""scripted"", the presenters head to Zadar county and the island of Pag in Croatia to make a completely ""unscripted"" film.[52][53] This results in Clarkson turning up in the Audi TT RS, Hammond turning up in the not at all comparable Ariel Nomad, and May turning up in an old Lada Riva which he turns into a fire engine. They go their separate ways though Clarkson and Hammond end up comparing their cars in a drag race, a rally stage (both of which are won by Clarkson), visiting Maslenica, the Plitvice Lakes National Park, and following the D106 road until running out of road at Žigljen ferry port.[52][53] Due to a lack of fires, May has to setup his own ones until Clarkson and Hammond setup one that proves too difficult for May, which the real fire brigade manage to put out with a firefighting aircraft, destroying May's Lada fire engine in the process. Michael Ball and Alfie Boe compete in ""Celebrity Face Off"" with Ball setting the faster time and becoming the ""fastest classical singer with some kind of interesting connection to the British motor industry"".

""Up, Down and Round the Farm""[57]

Bill Bailey, Dominic Cooper, Mark Higgins
5 January 2018 (2018-01-05)


The presenters introduce some of the new cars for 2018 in Conversation Street. Hammond heads to Dubai to test a Sandrail dune buggy in the desert, followed by the Ripsaw ""high-end luxury tank"", visiting the Dubai Mall. May reviews the Volkswagen Up! GTI at the Eboladrome and in thick fog Eaton records a record slow time. Guests Bill Bailey and Dominic Cooper discuss their shared ownership of old French cars before racing each other in greasy/wet conditions with Cooper becoming the ""fastest person who has a failed former career in a band"". Clarkson creates a Ken Block-style ""Farmkhana""[m 2] film using an old Subaru Impreza WRX STi around Hare Farm, near Rye, with bullet time photography.[56] Hammond and May show the audience that Clarkson's driving was mostly fake by sharing a ""making-of"" consisting of outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage featuring rally driver Mark Higgins, producer Phil Churchward, plus camera operator Ben Joiner breaking the fourth wall. Clarkson suggests that the whole thing is like sawing a woman in half during a magic show, and that really the audience don't want to know.

The presenters head to the area around Grand Junction, Colorado, staying at the Gateway Canyons Resort & Spa,[58] and eventually travelling to Telluride, Colorado with a variety of old Jaguar cars to establish the manufacturer's reputation for reliability with Clarkson buying an XJR, May taking an XK8 convertible and Hammond bringing a Mark X. During the course of the trip the cars are driven around a dirt track (where Hammond's car is badly damaged, and is replaced by an XJ6), along the runway at Telluride Regional Airport,[58] (where May's car is destroyed, and is replaced by an XJS) and down the slopes of the Telluride Ski Resort. At Hanging Flume overlook, Clarkson experiences a traffic stop by a Mesa County police officer and reads the ""Her Britannic Majesty"" text from his British passport.[59] Despite Clarkson's car being the best, May admitting his car had poor brakes deemed the challenge pointless. The presenters discuss the annoyance of Firemen cutting the roofs of cars in Conversation Street. Kiefer Sutherland beats Luke Evans to become ""the fastest actor with a middle name of George"".

""It's a Gas, Gas, Gas""[61]
Lamborghini Huracán Performante
Anthony Joshua, Bill Goldberg
19 January 2018 (2018-01-19)


The presenters discuss some new supercars and how handbrake turns impress women within the Conversation Street Segment. Hammond tests the Lamborghini Huracán Performante at the Eboladrome beating May's Ferrari 458 Speciale in a drag race before Eaton takes it round the track setting a fast time. May and Hammond then look at ingenious ways of filling up with fuel instead of stopping at a fuel station. Anthony Joshua becomes ""the fastest man who makes a living out of punching or strangling someone"" beating Bill Goldberg, with both previously owning cars from General Motors. Clarkson then talks about the Rivalry in rallying between Audi with the Quattro and Lancia with the 037. They conclude with a ""terrible disappointment"" that Lancia is no longer around.

26 January 2018 (2018-01-26)


The presenters head to the City of Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France, and home of the Pau Grand Prix on the Circuit de Pau-Ville (fr) street course. At Palais Beaumont (fr) Hammond arrives with a Jagaur XK SS and Clarkson in an Aston Martin DB4 GT; both being modern builds of older designs from the 1950s ""back-catalogues"" of Jaguar and Aston Martin. They both race around the Streets of Pau before May turns up in a modern Honda Civic Type R to prove that new cars are better. All three depart to drive south over the Pyrenees mountain range, with Clarkson and Hammond experiencing difficulties in dense fog. Clarkson recants a previous incident from 2013—when Clarkson and Hammond's driving licences were confiscated whilst filming The Perfect Road Trip in France—and tries to goad May into speeding on the Autopista AP-2. At Barcelona the presenters race around the abandoned Autódromo de Sitges-Terramar and the extreme banking on its corners, with May winning, and Hammond abstaining following his history of crashes. During Conversation Street the presenters discuss names for gritters. At the Eboladrome, Clarkson retests the Ford GT following the Niagara Falls race, with Eaton setting a test lap. Nick Mason goes on to record a faster lap than Stewart Copeland to become ""the fastest drummer for a band beginning with the letter p"".

""Breaking, Badly""[63]
Jaguar XJ220, Bugatti EB 110 Super Sport
Dynamo, Penn & Teller
2 February 2018 (2018-02-02)


The presenters discuss new sport cars by various companies, jumpers and the speed of pigeons vs blackbirds during Conversation Street. Clarkson unsuccessfully sets out to prove that mankind has not significantly improved over the last 25 years by testing the Jaguar XJ220 and the Bugatti EB 110 Super Sport, the fastest supercars from the early 90s, both of which set slow times at the Eboladrome when driven by Eaton. The trio tries to break the UK speed record for amphibious vehicles by building one of their own. Clarkson oversees his idea of combining a Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engine from a Nimrod jet and a speedboat with a Suzuki Jimny. However on a nearby lake, Clarkson and May have to abort their run after achieving only 3 mph (5 km/h) and nearly sinking. Hammond and May then go on to build a vehicle of their own by combining a Bond Bug with the engine of a personal water craft nicknaming it the ""Pond Bug"". Competing on Coniston Water during Coniston Power Boat Records Week, Clarkson, being the only one with a speedboat licence, operates the ""Pond Bug"" and achieves an average of 47.81 mph (76.94 km/h), setting a new UK record. After performing a series of magic tricks, Dynamo and Penn & Teller compete to become ""the fastest magician in the world"", with Penn & Teller prevailing on a snowy track.

""Oh, Canada""[65]
Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, Range Rover Velar P380, Porsche Macan Turbo Performance Pack, Tesla Model X, Ford F150 Raptor
Rory McIlroy, Paris Hilton
9 February 2018 (2018-02-09)


The presenters head to Canada to prove that small SUV's are useless with Clarkson picking an Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, May choosing a Range Rover Velar P380 and Hammond taking a Porsche Macan Turbo Performance Pack. They are shown to be slower round the Area 27 circuit than a BMW M3, not practical enough to carry Canadian Newfoundland dogs, and slower round a barrel course than a horse: concluding that SUVs are pointless. Despite this, executive producer Andy Wilman informs via text that they will race their SUVs whilst each towing a boat up a mountain. May abandons his Velar for his boat, which sinks, causing him to lose the race. Because Clarkson's Stelvio has no tow bar he cheats and exchanges it for a Ford F150 Raptor, ultimately arriving first with the presenters concluding that the Raptor was better than all the SUVs being tested. On Conversation Street the presenters talk about new SUVs and vans. Clarkson reviews the Tesla Model X at the Eboladrome and on the road, accompanied by some lawyers, ostensibly to avoid Tesla pursuing any legal action, following the previous Tesla v. Top Gear court cases.[64] Rory McIlroy and Paris Hilton discuss their car collections before McIlroy beats Hilton to become the ""World's Fastest Golfing Enthusiast"".

""Feed the World""[66]

16 February 2018 (2018-02-16)


The presenters head to Mozambique on a mission to feed the people of Bingo, an isolated town in the west of the country, with fish from the country's capital of Maputo, covering a distance of approximately 200 miles. To do this, each of them attempt to find the best transport solution: May buys a Mercedes-Benz Estate and modifies it by fitting a Perspex tank filled with sea water in which to keep the fish alive; Clarkson buys a Nissan Hardbody truck which he fits with a generator and an ice machine in an attempt to keep the fish frozen and Hammond buys a TVS Star motorcycle and devises a rack which he fits to the bike's rear, inspired by a local method of drying and salting the fish to preserve them. After unsuccessfully trying to catch fish using local methods, they buy fish at a local market. Early in the journey, Clarkson's truck crashes into May's car upon rescuing it, damaging its radiator grille. Deeper into rural Mozambique, May constantly soaks himself with sea water from his ill-fitted tank and, due to his damaged radiator grille, suffers multiple breakdowns due to water intrusion. Hammond loses a large number of his fish on the bumpy roads, constantly gets stuck in thick mud and endlessly falls from his motorbike. Clarkson suffers very few issues except when his ice machine breaks, causing him to make small adjustments to his truck in order to smoke the fish with his exhaust. Upon May's car breaking down in the middle of a lake, despite Hammond and Clarkson crossing successfully, Clarkson cuts off the front end of the Mercedes and tows what remains of the rear portion using his truck - much to May's dismay and annoyance. Eventually, the three reach Bingo with May's fish dead, Clarkson's fish ruined and Hammond having almost no fish left. As a result, they sell no fish and leave Bingo in a helicopter ""like all charitable celebrities"".

Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold, but his death in 1446 put an end to this project, and the walls of the dome were whitewashed. Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment. This enormous work, 3,600 metres² (38 750 ft²) of painted surface, was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579. The upper portion, near the lantern, representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574. Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators, such as Domenico Cresti, finished the other portions: (from top to bottom) Choirs of Angels; Christ, Mary and Saints; Virtues, Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes; and at the bottom of the cupola: Capital Sins and Hell. These frescoes are considered Zuccari's greatest work. But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques. Vasari had used true fresco, while Zuccari had painted in secco. During the restoration work, which ended in 1995, the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue.

Nick awakens in a heroin den in an abandoned church, to find his girlfriend Gloria eating a corpse. While fleeing, he is hit by a car and hospitalized. The doctor tells Madison and Travis that Nick's claims about the incident are heroin hallucinations, but Travis believes Nick after visiting the church himself. Alicia becomes more worried about Nick's chemical dependency. The next day, school closes early due to the high levels of absenteeism and rumors of an epidemic. Nick escapes from the hospital and meets with Calvin, hoping to learn if the drugs Calvin sold him caused him to hallucinate in the church. Calvin tries to kill Nick to prevent him from exposing Calvin as a drug dealer or impugning the quality of his drugs. In the ensuing struggle, Calvin is mortally shot. After Travis and Madison arrive, the zombified Calvin attacks them. Nick runs over Calvin repeatedly with Travis' truck, and the three watch in disbelief as the mutilated Calvin is still able to turn his head towards them.

With Max still a little girl, their parents pay more attention to Max (Maxine), and Alex becomes jealous. Justin takes Maxine to her (Max's) karate class and Maxine kicks Justin's butt. After the class, Alex decides to make Jerry's favorite sandwich in order to win his love back, but Maxine comes along with Justin, announcing that she beat Justin in karate, and Jerry immediately falls for her cuteness again. More jealous than ever, Alex comes back with Justin to Maxine's karate class with their parents, having a slight idea of knowing how to change Maxine back to Max. They cast spells on Maxine, Justin using the spell he used on Max that turned him into Maxine, and Alex using the reverse spell. Unfortunately, it only makes Maxine cuter, which makes her furious. Instead of going against the person she was supposed to, she demands that she kicks either Alex or Justin's butt. Justin goes against her, but seeing that he would lose, Alex casts a spell on Justin to make him a karate master. Too fast for Maxine, Justin beats her, and Maxine is hurt (physically). Jerry and Theresa rush to her side, caring for Maxine more than they care that Justin beat Maxine in karate. Justin leaves, and Alex leaves after him, heartbroken. Back at home, Jerry tells Alex that he fell for Maxine because she reminded him of Alex when she was little and they bond again. Meanwhile, Zeke thinks the Russos hate him, but really it was just Harper's alibi in order to keep him away from the Sub Station so as not to make him suspicious about Max's disappearance and Maxine's appearance.

Maxine uses her charming cuteness to convince the customers to not exploit her parents. Meanwhile, Justin kicks Rosie out of his class so that it does not fail the wizard dance assessment. Sympathizing, Alex gets Rosie to rejoin the class and puts a copycat spell on her so that Rosie can mimic Alex's move and pass the class. The assessment ends in disaster when a squirrel-frog attaches itself to Alex's foot, and Rosie reveals herself to be an angel. The class fails, but Justin starts dating Rosie.

Justin and Rosie start dating but when their date gets ruined, they want a second date. Alex suggests an Angel Club in Los Angeles, but Rosie says that only Angels are allowed. Maxine will not tell their parents as long as Alex brings her back an Ozzy Osbourne stone. After Justin, Harper and Alex sneak in along with Rosie, Zeedrik asks them if they are angels and they say they are. Back at the sub shop, Theresa and Jerry question Maxine to find out where Justin, Alex and Harper are, and Maxine does not say, so they force her to join a Pageant in order for her to tell them where they are. Things get bad at the angel club when Alex and Harper cannot fly, until Justin secretly pulls out his wand and gives Harper flying powers. Zeedrik still questions them by giving them a test to sing while playing the harp. Though Alex, Justin, and Harper fail to do so, they are accepted as ""angels"" until the key-chain of Ozzy Osbourne's star reverts to normal. Zeedrik believes they are really angels of darkness, causing everyone in the club to run off, even Rosie. Rosie comes back at the end of the episode to comfort Justin, but when they both look over the city, Rosie's wings are shown to be black, the color of an angel of darkness' wings, but Justin does not see because he is looking forward. Meanwhile, Maxine ends up winning the beauty pageant, making Jerry and Theresa celebrate.

Rosie tries to get Justin to run away and save him, because Gorog wants to destroy him, but Justin refuses to leave, stating that he is no longer a wizard but an Angel of Darkness and breaks his wand in halves.

The current landlord of the Russo's building decides to sell the sub shop, evicting the Russos of the shop, as well as their apartment and lair, which contains their portal. Without the portal, the Russos will lose all contact with the Wizard world. So, the entire family (along with Harper) travel back to 1957 to stop Jerry's father (the previous owner of the shop) from selling the shop to the landlord, so that they do not get evicted. Jerry's father agrees not to sell the shop, and the Russos return to present day. However, they accidentally leave Harper behind when Harper is distracted by a woman with a poodle, and Harper suggests that the woman should put a picture of a poodle on her skirt, creating a poodle skirt, which were popular in the 1950s.
Back in present day, the Russos (who have not yet realized Harper's absence) find the sub shop obsolete, boarded up, and empty, with the subway car and the lair missing, too. The Russos realized that they have messed with the fabric of time, and something they did while time-traveling in 1957 must have created a ripple effect, and affected present day.
While Alex suggests that they go back to 1957 to find out what they did wrong, Justin denies this, saying they should not solve the problem by doing exactly what caused the problem, however Theresa states that they will have to go back, when she realizes that they left Harper in 1957. The Russos return to 1957, where Jerry's father reveals that he did not sell the restaurant to the landlord, however the restaurant failed to make enough business, and that he has been forced to close it. Justin realizes that when Jerry's father lost the restaurant, he moved out of the building and since their family no longer lived in the building, the lair disappeared in present day. The Russos decide just to find Harper and go back to present day, and discover that Harper enrolled at Tribeca Prep as soon as they forgot her in 1957, as Harper did not want to ruin her perfect attendance record. Justin, Alex, and Max go to Tribeca Prep to retrieve Harper, while Jerry and Theresa wait at the sub shop, however Harper decides to stay in the past, as she finds new popularity in 1957 that she does not experience in present day. While at Tribeca, Max introduces the high-five to several students. Alex realizes that if they make the sub shop the 1957 high school hangout, the sub shop will get better business and will not have to close. However, no one has any fun at the sub shop that night as the jukebox is broken. Just as everyone is about to leave, Max plugs his MP3 player into the jukebox and Harper uses her popularity to get the students dancing and having fun at the shop, and the business at the sub shop peaks. The Russos return to the present day, where the lair and the sub shop are back, and Jerry owns the entire building, while the landlord is now the owner of a Janitor service, instead of the building, and the high-five is now called a ""Max"". Alex then remembers that they forgot Harper back in 1957 and they go back and get her. (the Russos accidentally end up in 1977 twice in the episode, thanks to Justin)

They go down (through the door) into the street and Alex turns the hot dog stand into a carriage to take Harper to the party. There she dances with prince charming, Zeke. At the stroke of midnight she goes outside leaving her glass slipper behind.
Then, to both girls' shock, Justin, Max and Zeke (with pig noses) rush inside the substation being chased by the big, bad wolf, Mason. Alex realizes that some pages are missing and Cinderella and three little pigs stories were blended together. The pig-turned boys and Harper rush into the loft being chased by Mason. While Alex finds the pages Harper has to keep Mason from eating Zeke (who built the straw house), Alex eventually finds the book pages in a drawer along with other book pages. Alex tries a page from Max's favourite magic trick book then David Copperfield comes into the room and does some magic tricks which impresses Harper. But another page that Alex tried was from Justin's science book and a caveman appeared, but the caveman has a thing for Harper. So when Harper is impressed by the magic trick he is jealous and tries to attack David Copperfield. Alex finds the right pages and the story goes back to Cinderella. Zeke Charming comes in and Theresa tries to wear the slipper but fails. Then Harper tries it and fits. She and Zeke go back to the royal party where they dance and then the story ends and the world is returned to its normality. Last but not least, Harper was back in the real world and she lived happily ever after. Finally, Alex planned that Harper and Zeke dance because they were great when they danced in romance, so they practiced but they were really bad. The ball dance is turned into a clogging dance.

""Who Will Be the Family Wizard""[27]

During a dinner that Alex made for the family, Professor Crumbs visits to reveal that with this selfless act, the Russo children can finally have their family wizard competition. Round one of the competition is a trivia round, in which questions related to magic are asked. During this round, Harper and Zeke appear. Zeke has accidentally smelled a purple substance in the lair that caused him to turn purple. This causes a griffin to kidnap him and Harper. Alex, Justin and Max use their three time-outs to go and rescue their friends. They make it back, only to discover that they have been gone too long and have been disqualified from the competition. They all return home, where the lair disappears and they all lose their magic, thus becoming mortals. Justin and Max begin to hate Alex because of her insistence on saving Zeke and Harper resulting in them losing. Convinced that the loss of their powers has ruined the family, Jerry decides to sell the sub shop. The kids go for a day without magic, during which, slowly gaining back trust in each other as they reopen and run the shop. Suddenly, they are returned to the area of the Wizard Competition, where the host reveals that the griffin attack (which was actually meant for Professor Crumbs) and the weeks they went without magic were tests to test their family bond. They enter the final round of the competition, a massive labyrinth. The first out of the maze will win. Justin makes it out first and is declared the Family Wizard. However, he decides he cannot accept this because Alex was about to get out first: Justin had been trapped by magical vines and Alex, near the exit, came back to help. Alex is thus declared the true family wizard. Professor Crumbs, proud of Justin's integrity in telling the truth, declares that he is going to retire as Headmaster of Wiz-Tech and declares Justin the new headmaster, granting him full wizard powers. Considering Max is the only Russo child that does not get powers or becomes a full wizard, Jerry thus decides to one day pass down the sub shop to Max, which he happily accepts. It ends with the Russo family hugging and gathering together with Alex stating that they are all finally happy at the same time.

Her career took off when in 1979 Jack Woolley offered her a job at Grey Gables and she eventually became manager. Upon Jack's retirement, she and partner Oliver Sterling managed to raise funds to buy the hotel and she became the proprietor. On her arrival she soon attracted the attention of many of the male villagers — she once had an affair with Brian Aldridge, and was romantically linked with former village doctor, Matthew Thorogood, and businessman and one-time estate owner Cameron Fraser (who disappeared with £60,000 of her savings), and she was engaged to non-stipendiary minister and vet Robin Stokes. In 1995 she married the new owner of the estate, Guy Pemberton (Hugh Dickson).[25] After only seven months of marriage he suffered a fatal heart attack and left her the Dower House and a majority share in the Bull (which she sold to Lilian Bellamy, in order to raise funds to buy Grey Gables).

Although it only charted in Norway and Sweden (where it was a top 20 hit in both countries), it was one of Zappa's songs which had the most airplay on American FM radio, at the time still album-centered. The song was played in concert from 1980 to 1988 along with the song ""Why Does it Hurt When I Pee?"" in all tours of Zappa's after the single's release.

2017,Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,who is subject to foreign corruption practices act,"The idea of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is to make it illegal for companies and their supervisors to influence foreign officials with any personal payments or rewards.[3][page needed] The FCPA applies to any person who has a certain degree of connection to the United States and engages in foreign corrupt practices. The Act also applies to any act by U.S. businesses, foreign corporations trading securities in the U.S., American nationals, citizens, and residents acting in furtherance of a foreign corrupt practice whether or not they are physically present in the U.S. This is considered the nationality principle of the act. Any individuals that are involved in those activities may face prison time.[3][page needed] This act was passed to make it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.[4][full citation needed][3] In the case of foreign natural and legal persons, the Act covers their deeds if they are in the U.S. at the time of the corrupt conduct. This is considered the protective principle of the act.[3] Further, the Act governs not only payments to foreign officials, candidates, and parties, but any other recipient if part of the bribe is ultimately attributable to a foreign official, candidate, or party. These payments are not restricted to monetary forms and may include anything of value.[5] This is considered the territoriality principle of the act.[3]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iris has been aiding Team Flash in Central City for six months, but refuses to grieve Barry. A flying samurai with superpowers appears in Central City, threatening to destroy the city if the real Flash does not face him. Cisco reveals he has formulated a way to bring back Barry without destabilizing the Speed Force and tracks down Caitlin for help, but is forbidden by Iris to bring Barry back. Against Iris' orders, Team Flash successfully returns Barry, who rambles random statements and continually writes symbols on the walls. Wally engages the samurai, but is defeated. Cisco deciphers Barry's writings and finds an apparently meaningless sentence. In an attempt to recover Barry's memories, Iris gives herself up to the samurai. The plan works and Barry speeds away, rescuing Iris and defeating the samurai, who is revealed to be an android. Caitlin rejoins Team Flash, but is revealed to have been working for a mobster called Amunet, while also continuing to prevent the Killer Frost personality from emerging. The ""Samuroid"" is revealed to have been controlled by the Thinker, whose plan was to draw out the Flash for his next schemes.

When Barry, Joe, and Cisco report to a crime scene, they discover remnants of a mysterious code. Cisco presents Barry with a technologically advanced suit, intended to facilitate his activities. He tests it out, trying to save someone from a haywire car controlled by metahuman Ramsey Deacon. Gypsy arrives on Earth-1 for a date with Cisco, who is forced to cancel it so as to focus on Deacon. Acting on a suggestion from Caitlin, Iris signs her and Barry up for couples therapy to sort out their relationship. Deacon kidnaps a witness, a former member of a tech team that stole his idea for profit. Barry and Wally go to save him, but Deacon uses his abilities to send Barry's suit haywire. On Iris' instruction, Barry throws lightning at himself, shorting out his suit. He then incapacitates Deacon, who is locked up in the meta wing of Iron Heights, revealed to be part of the Thinker's plan. Cisco finally goes out with Gypsy. Wondering how Deacon gained his powers being absent during the particle accelerator incident, Barry and Joe learn from Deacon that there are ""others.""

In flashbacks, the Thinker observes Becky Sharpe, a woman with seemingly unending bad luck, and determines that she will be easily manipulated. In the present, Becky robs a bank and gets away when Barry slips on marbles. Harry arrives from Earth-2 and tells Wally that Jesse has decided to break up with him in order to focus on her vigilantism. Cisco deduces that Becky is a metahuman with the power of favorable luck while inducing misfortune to others. Barry realizes that the portal he used to escape the Speed Force exposed an entire busload of people, including Becky and Deacon, to transformative dark matter. Harry informs Cisco that Jesse has expelled him from her crime-fighting team due to his attitude. Becky's powers expand out of control, reactivating the particle accelerator, which Harry deliberately allows, nullifying Becky's powers and leading to her incarceration. Cisco and Harry identify twelve new metahumans created on the bus and the latter suspects that an unknown party has manipulated the events surrounding Barry's return. Wally decides to leave on a journey to find himself. The Thinker is revealed to be spying on S.T.A.R. Labs through the ""Samuroid"" helmet. Joe learns Cecile is pregnant.

Gypsy's father, Breacher, attacks Cisco, vowing to hunt and kill him in 24 hours, allowing the romance should he survive. Team Flash learns that the bus driver was murdered and tracks down another passenger, Ralph Dibny, former corrupt CCPD detective exposed by Barry and currently an infamous private investigator. As two thugs attack Dibny, he is revealed to have the power to stretch. Caitlin stabilizes his powers with a serum. The team learns that Ralph has been blackmailing Mayor Bellows for adultery, with the latter revealed to have hired the thugs. Barry confronts Ralph for his actions while the latter scolds him, claiming to have been a ""good cop"". He later stops blackmailing Bellows, who still attempts to kill him while Breacher mistakes the former for a Plastoid, the species that invaded Earth-19 previously, and attacks him. Cisco intervenes and saves Ralph, whom Barry, having revealed his alter-ego, convinces to help arrest an escaping Bellows. Admiring Cisco's gallantry, Breacher allows the relationship. Barry recruits Ralph for Team Flash and learns that someone named DeVoe instructed Ralph to watch Bellows. Barry remembers that Abra Kadabra and Savitar both mentioned DeVoe. Meanwhile, Caitlin finds a message on her apartment door.

Joe confronts her, who states she is only doing feminist research. Ralph incites a brawl, leading to the men's arrest until Harry posts bail. Meanwhile, Amunet's enforcer, Norvock, demands Caitlin's return and attacks the women when she refuses. Killer Frost emerges and repels him, later telling Iris that Caitlin accepted Amunet's employment in exchange for the means to control Frost. Learning that Amunet is holding a metahuman she calls ""the Weeper"", whose tears are a strong narcotic, prisoner and intends to sell him, Iris's party decides to stop her. Though Caitlin refuses to join, she attacks Amunet when seeing her friends in danger. Using a strong magnet, the team robs Amunet's metal shards, leaving her powerless. Iris dissuades Frost from killing Amunet, who promises revenge. Both parties refuse to tell each other about their adventures. Iris asks Caitlin to be her maid of honor while Joe convinces Joanie to tell Cecile about her research. DeVoe captures the Weeper.

Barry trains Ralph to use his abilities, with Cisco making a stretchable suit for him. Another bus metahuman, a Lakota Sioux Native named Mina Chayton, who can animate statues, starts attacking Central City & stealing pieces of a Black Bison necklace, which she claims belongs to her tribe. When Barry and Ralph catch up to her, she attacks Barry with a caveman statue and attempts a getaway. Ralph chooses to stop her, but a little girl is injured in the process. Ralph regrets his actions, but is comforted by Barry. Chayton escapes CCPD, going after the last necklace piece held at the museum. When Barry and Ralph confront her, she brings a dinosaur skeleton to life. Barry arrests Chayton while Ralph saves a security guard from the skeleton. Later, Ralph reveals he mailed the necklace back to Chayton's tribe, before visiting the little girl in the hospital, using his abilities to entertain her. Meanwhile, Harry, trying to make friends, works with his doppelgangers of alternate Earths, The Council of Wells. They figure out that DeVoe is a man named Clifford DeVoe.

Barry, Oliver, Sara, Alex, Martin and Jax wake up in a Nazi concentration camp on Earth-X wearing power dampeners. The arriving SS Sturmbannführer is revealed to be the Earth-X doppelgänger of Quentin Lance, who plans to execute them, but they are saved by Citizen Cold (the Earth-X doppelgänger of Leonard Snart) and Ray Terrill. Snart and Terrill take them to the headquarters of the Freedom Fighters, where the team meets the resistance movement's leader, General Schott (Winn Schott's Earth-X doppelgänger). They learn that the only way back to Earth-1 is through a temporal gateway in a research facility, which Schott plans to blow up to strand Dark Arrow (Oliver's Earth-X doppelgänger) on Earth-1. Oliver disguises himself as Dark Arrow to infiltrate the facility and discovers the Nazi doomsday device against parallel Earths is a militarized timeship called Wellenreiter. Barry and Ray battle the Freedom Fighters' Red Tornado to stop it from destroying the gateway while the rest of the team enters the facility to reactivate its portal, during which Stein is shot and gravely wounded. On Earth-1, Eobard Thawne prepares to perform surgery on Kara to save Overgirl. Felicity and Iris try to stop him, but are captured.

Barry stands trial for the murder of Clifford DeVoe, with Cecile representing him. Cisco and Joe have to leave during the trial for a meta investigation, in which a meta caused people to collapse. Singh reveals to Joe he is appearing as a witness for the prosecution against Barry. The meta is eventually discovered as Neil Borman, who is a meta who produces radiation, which is causing the illness and collapsing. Barry takes him on, but is ill equipped to deal with the situation. Cisco and Killer Frost travel to the scene where Caitlin tries to freeze Borman, who quickly defrosts and incapacitates Caitlin. Barry creates a vacuum seal around Borman to contain the radiation, with Cisco transporting the radiation to the dead Earth-15, draining the meta and defeating him. Barry is eventually found guilty by the jury and is sentenced to life in prison.

Barry uses his speed to secretly help the guards contain the other inmates during a prison riot. He also befriends Dave Ratchet, his father's former cellmate. The next day, Barry meets Axel Walker who was later broken out of prison by his mother Zoey Clark, his father's one-time partner Prank. Axel challenges Ralph by threatening to cause chaos in the city. Ralph attempts to stop him but is wounded by Axel and is evacuated by Cisco. Ralph sneaks into the prison to talk to Barry about how scared he is. Barry reassures him that being a hero isn't about not being scared, but about having the ability to rise above your fear. Cisco and Caitlin go to rescue the hostages, but get captured by Axel and Zoey, who intend to kill them. Ralph arrives, and attempts to shield the two from an acid shower, until Wells manages to hack into the shower system to neutralize its acidity. Iris visits Barry in prison, where they reaffirm their love for each other. Ralph and Cisco go to get coffee, where they meet the excitable girl from the wedding. The girl writes in her journal, where she appears to be writing in the language Barry was using when he came out of the Speed Force.

Cecile develops telepathic abilities as a result of her pregnancy, combined with dormant dark matter in her cells, which Caitlin assures her should be temporary. In prison, Barry learns that Ratchet is innocent of a robbery-homicide that was actually committed by Sylbert Rundine fifteen years prior. Barry asks the team to look into the case. Rundine turns out to be a bus meta with the ability to shrink and enlarge objects, and he shrinks Cisco and Ralph while escaping. Harry's attempted cure backfires, and Caitlin determines that if they are not re-enlarged within a certain period of time, their bodies will explode. The team confronts Rundine at a warehouse, where Harry tricks him into re-enlarging Ralph and Cisco. Rundine is arrested, but refuses to confess to the earlier crime. Barry gathers that even if Ratchet went free, he would be as unhappy in the city as he is in prison; he wishes to live in a secluded Chinese village called Jiaju, but fears he will never get there. Barry then uses his speed to take Ratchet to Jiaju, where he can live out his dream. After discovering Barry is the Flash, the prison's warden, Gregory Wolfe, locks Barry in his private metahuman wing, intending to sell him to Amunet.

Wolfe plans to sell Barry and the imprisoned bus metas (Ramsey Deacon, Becky Sharpe, Mina Chaytan, and Sylbert Rundine) to Amunet, so they plan to escape. Cecile discovers Wolfe's plans after reading his mind. Ralph encounters a former colleague and his negative interaction with him prompts the discovery that he can shapeshift. His lack of mastery of the new ability prevents his attempt to foil Amunet's deal with Wolfe. Barry helps the metas escape the power dampeners, but they are cornered by Wolfe and Amunet. DeVoe arrives and again uses his chair to extract the metas' abilities, before transferring his mind into Sharpe's body. He then crushes Wolfe's skull as Marlize looks on in horror; Amunet flees. Ralph uses his shapeshifting ability to appear as the original DeVoe at Barry's appeal, claiming that he was unconscious at Barry's loft but not dead, which clears Barry's name. Team Flash realizes that DeVoe is only stealing powers from metahumans who were on the bus when the dark matter wave was unleashed, which means he will likely target Ralph as well. Back at the DeVoes' house, their marriage continues to deteriorate, and DeVoe drugs his wife with the Weeper's tears to maintain her devotion towards him.

Barry is put on indefinite leave at the CCPD due to his connection with the DeVoe case. The team encounter another bus metahuman named Izzy with sound wave abilities, amplified by her violin. She manages to use her abilities when DeVoe (inside Sharpe's body) comes to claim her. Barry and Ralph help to train Izzy to refine her abilities, which proves difficult when she gets hurt. Eventually DeVoe shows up once again, using Dominic's and Becky's abilities to make Barry experience a brain aneurysm, while using Rundine's abilities to incapacitate Ralph. DeVoe then once again uses the chair to transfer his mind into Izzy's body and escapes. Both Ralph and Barry comfort each other over their respective losses: Barry being let go from the police force and Ralph losing Izzy to DeVoe. These losses enforce both Barry's and Ralph's determination to bring DeVoe down and save the three remaining metas.

Jesse comes to Earth-1 to have a talk with her dad. Eco-terrorist Veronica Dale sets off a nuclear bomb, which Barry tries to stop, entering a form of superspeed known as Flashtime, where everything is frozen. However, the bomb has already detonated, and he and Jesse cannot stop it or save everyone with superspeed. Jay Garrick comes from Earth-3 to help, but they are still unable to stop it. Barry remains in Flashtime for hours, bringing each of his friends into it, in an attempt to find a solution; they discuss options such as freezing it or sending it to another Earth, but none of those solutions prove to be viable. Eventually, Iris gives him the idea to retrieve the Quark Sphere from the Speed Force to send a blast lightning through the bomb, enough to disable it. Barry does so, and throws the Sphere back into the Speed Force, saving Central City. Jay admits he is retiring and going to train a new ""female"" speedster. Jesse and Jay return to their Earths, and Caitlin and Wells go for a coffee, where they encounter the mysterious girl.

A metahuman with fire powers tries to rob Central City bank. Another bus meta named Matthew Kim touches the metahuman, which causes his powers to transfer to another individual. When Joe, Iris and Barry turn up to ask Kim a few questions, Barry and Iris come into contact with Kim, causing Barry to lose his speed and Iris to gain superspeed. Inspired by Thawne, Harry plans to build his own thinking cap to outwit DeVoe. With their roles reversed, Iris becomes Central City's hero speedster, while Barry must learn to act as team leader. The new metahuman demands money and terrorizes the city with his fire powers. Using Wells' thinking cap, the Team comes up with the idea for Iris to create a tidal wave, negating the flames and defeating the meta. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Kim touches Iris and Barry again, restoring the Flash's speed. At home, Iris admits that while she did enjoy having superspeed, Central City needs the light that Barry was, and she is happy being team leader. Wells uses his thinking cap once more, determining the final two bus metas are Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss.

Barry and Ralph train to defeat DeVoe, with Barry becoming annoyed at Ralph's apparent inability to be serious. The team manages to locate another bus meta, Janet Petty. When Barry and Ralph confront her, it is revealed that Petty can manipulate a person's gravitational pull, which she demonstrates on Barry. Fearing once again that Ralph is not taking things seriously, Barry refuses to work with him. Ralph reveals his comedic attitude is due to a difficult childhood where his father abandoned him, causing him to make jokes whenever he is scared or under pressure. Barry relents and they go to stop Janet at a gala event. Janet uses her powers on Barry, causing him to float into the atmosphere. Barry tells the team to trust Ralph to improvise. Ralph detains Janet, then becomes a giant airbag to allow Barry to land safely. DeVoe's wife discovers he has been drugging her, so she will continue to assist him. Breacher comes to Earth-1 to ask Cisco for help as some of his powers have failed. Harry takes the thinking cap to Thawne's time vault to recharge it and activates Gideon.

Team Flash track down the final bus meta Edwin Gauss, but are followed by the Samuroid, who injures Caitlin. The team rush back to Star Labs to regroup and heal. Caitlin reveals to Iris that Killer Frost is activated by her adrenal gland, and she is working on a way to separate them. Harry comes up with a tuning fork weapon that mimics Izzy's abilities in order to defeat DeVoe. Ralph reveals to Barry that he isn't afraid of losing his own life, but of Team Flash losing theirs, as he considers them family. Wells is shown to be addicted to the Thinking Cap, which Joe helps him deal with. Ralph takes the fork, with the intent to go with Edwin to kill DeVoe, which Barry argues against. Eventually, DeVoe manages to take over Edwin's mind, and as well takes the abilities of Janet Petty and Matthew Kim, before transferring his mind into Ralph's body. The team try to stop him, but DeVoe incapacitates them, and alters Caitlin's DNA, removing the dark matter and Killer Frost, before leaving. Back at his lair, DeVoe uses Ralph's morphing abilities to morph back into his original form, while he and Marlize plan their next move to destroy Team Flash.

With DeVoe moving forwards with his plans, Team Flash decide to secure Neil Borman. Barry and Cisco travel to Earth X to recruit Leo Snart as a backup, but are followed to Earth 1 by the Earth X doppelganger of Laurel Lance. Team Flash plan to deliver Borman to a safe ARGUS facility, using a suit to contain the radiation, with Snart on hand, in case Borman goes nuclear. Snart agrees to help, but claims he can only stay for 24 hours, as he is due to get married to Ray Terrill. DeVoe attempts to intercept the transfer, but he and Team Flash are further ambushed by Earth X Laurel, who kidnaps Caitlin, Borman and Joe, holding them at CCPD. Snart learns about Ralph, and convinces Barry to allow himself to grieve his fallen allies, which Barry eventually does, giving him strength to defeat Laurel. Lyla transfers Borman to another facility and Leo returns to Earth X. Cisco and Wells come up with a plan to boost Wells' thinking cap. Devoe goes more into his ""god-complex""; stating that human emotion is a weakness, causing Marlize to doubt him.

2084,Gastric acid,what is the role of hcl in the stomach,"Gastric acid, gastric juice or stomach acid, is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids. Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach, which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed. Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate, a base, to buffer the fluid, ensuring that it does not become too acidic. These cells also produce mucus, which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract.",NONE,"plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids",,,,,,,,,,,,

2119,Sonata form,identify the correct order of the sections of sonata allegro form,"
It may begin with an introduction, which is, in general, slower than the main movement. In terms of structure, introductions are an upbeat before the main musical argument.[clarification needed]
The first required section is the exposition. The exposition presents the primary thematic material for the movement: one or two themes or theme groups, often in contrasting styles and in opposing keys, connected by a modulating transition. The exposition typically concludes with a closing theme, a codetta, or both.
The exposition is followed by the development where the harmonic and textural possibilities of the thematic material are explored.
The development then re-transitions back to the recapitulation where the thematic material returns in the tonic key, and for the recapitulation to complete the musical argument, material that has not been stated in the tonic key is ""resolved"" by being played, in whole or in part, in the tonic.
The movement may conclude with a coda, beyond the final cadence of the recapitulation.

Melinda hears that there has been a fire at the Rockland University Building when Jim is called over there, and hurries over, fearful for Professor Rick Payne, but he is revealed to be alive and well. However, a therapist by the name Eli James dies, and Melinda witnesses his soul being brought back. This 'near-death' experience grants him the ability to hear ghosts. The episode is focused on the ghost of one of Eli's patients,who was possibly more than that, and whether or not she has been starting fires since she was 12. Whilst Melinda is trapped in the archives, she meets a group of seemingly benign ghosts calling themselves the watchers, who warn her that dealing with death may brush off on something she loves.

Melinda's mother hires a wedding planner who completely ignores what the couple want. Someone breaks into the University Library and then Zoe's house, but is interrupted by Eli. The thief only stole one book- called 'The Book of Changes' by the Watchers. It has important dates in it, such as previous deaths and Melinda's due date, which is why Carl the Watcher tells Eli not to let Melinda see or touch the book. Because the collection it was hidden in is being bought, the Watchers are trying to protect it. Melinda keeps getting visions of a faceless girl holding the book and saying that Mel's future is in 'her' hands and that Mel can't save 'her'. Mel is scared for her unborn baby, especially when she learns that it will be able to do much more than her (with their gift). Jim and Mel have a quiet wedding on the street where they first met, with only Delia and Eli in attendance, and Jim calls it a renewal of everything they already had and have. Mel is told she has lots of white light around her-spirits protecting her, but if the balance slips, that could change. Eli becomes 'The Book of Changes' new caretaker.

They had a great time, and got on very well. They went back to Stacey's hotel room and had sex. The next day, Stacey had to go back to Barry, but she and Gavin promised to keep ringing each other and that this would not be the end of their relationship. While Stacey and Nessa boarded the coach back to Barry, Gavin and Smithy got a cab back to Billericay. Without waiting for Smithy, Gavin jumped in his car and drove all the way to Barry, and met Stacey when her coach pulled into the station, to her surprise. He and Stacey told each other they loved each other for the first time. Within 9 weeks, they had got engaged and married. Despite a few initial problems regarding Stacey being homesick, their relationship was successful, and Stacey became eventually pregnant. Gavin, and his father Mick (Larry Lamb), often play the ""straight men"" in the series. Much of the comedy comes from the actions of those around them (especially his mother Pam (Alison Steadman) and Smithy). It is clear that Gavin loves his friends and family very much. Despite the fact that his mother Pam often overreacts and acts without thinking, Gavin still loves her, despite being occasionally exasperated by her. His best friend Smithy is also prone to overreact, but Gavin sticks with him and loves him like a little brother. Gavin's main personality flaw is that he is slightly spoiled, possibly due to being an only child, and reacts with irritation when he doesn't get his way. He is also not particularly sensitive - he sometimes fails to understand the much more emotional Smithy and Stacey, and this occasionally puts strain on his relationship with both of them - when Stacey, who is very attached to her hometown of Barry, gets depressed and homesick upon moving to Billericay after she and Gavin marry, Gavin is more confused than concerned about this, and his responses are lacking in sensitivity about the matter. This can also be seen in the fact that Gavin is less talkative and expressive than Stacey is - while at dinner with their families after their honeymoon, Stacey is excited and full of conversation, while Gavin simply sits and listens to her. Despite all of this, Gavin loves Stacey enormously, and is very affectionate towards her, and his greatest display of love for her is when he decides to move to Barry with her despite having expressed a dislike of it previously, and he manages to get himself a new job in Wales so he can reside there. There, his boss Huw Davies and colleague Owain Hughes (Steven Meo) act very similar to Stacey's uncle, Bryn (Rob Brydon), talking incessantly and being over-friendly, personality traits that bewilder Gavin. Gavin is more reserved and less willing to discuss his private life than his wife. He finds it odd that Stacey is so eager and ready to spill information about their private life to Nessa, Bryn, her mother Gwen (Melanie Walters) and her brother Jason (Robert Wilfort). When Gavin is applying for a job in Cardiff, the only people who know are Stacey and Mick. When he and Stacey announce it to the rest of the characters, Gwen announces that she knew as well, because Stacey told her. Gavin is annoyed that Stacey told Gwen, and by the fact that Stacey did not tell him she had told Gwen. He doesn't understand why Stacey always has to be so close to her family. It isn't that he is distant from his family, he just doesn't depend on his as much as Stacey does hers. In Series 3, he agrees with Stacey to try to have a baby, only to discover she stopped taking the pill a year ago. Although he is very angry about Stacey not telling him the truth, he becomes much more depressed when he learns that he has fertility problems. However, he eventually comes round, and has a serious discussion with Stacey about the problem, deciding they will carry on trying to conceive for a few months, and if that doesn't work, they should start looking at alternatives. However, in the final episode, Stacey discovers she pregnant, and Gavin is completely as overjoyed.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Grey matter is distinguished from white matter, in that it contains numerous cell bodies and relatively few myelinated axons, while white matter contains relatively few cell bodies and is composed chiefly of long-range myelinated axon tracts.[1] The colour difference arises mainly from the whiteness of myelin. In living tissue, grey matter actually has a very light grey colour with yellowish or pinkish hues, which come from capillary blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies.[2]",NONE,Grey matter,,,,,,,,,,,,

2190,Golden Gate Bridge,how long is the famous suspension bridge in san francisco and what is it called,"The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the American city of San Francisco, California – the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula – to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[7]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2191,United States corporate law,when did mandatory reporting become law in california,"The Wall Street Crash saw the total collapse of stock market values, as shareholders realized that corporations had become overpriced. They sold shares en masse, meaning meant companies found it hard to get finance. The result was that thousands of businesses were forced to close, and they laid off workers. Because workers had less money to spend, businesses received less income, leading to more closures and lay-offs. This downward spiral began the Great Depression. Berle and Means argued that under-regulation was the primary cause in their foundational book in 1932, The Modern Corporation and Private Property. They said directors had become too unaccountable, and the markets lacked basic transparency rules. This led directly to the New Deal reforms of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. A new Securities and Exchange Commission was empowered to require corporations disclose all material information about their business to the investing public. Because many shareholders were physically distant from corporate headquarters where meetings would take place, new rights were made to allow people to cast votes via proxies, on the view that this and other measures would make directors more accountable. Given these reforms, a major controversy still remained about the duties that corporations also owed to employees, other stakeholders, and the rest of society.[12] After World War Two, a general consensus emerged that directors were not bound purely to pursue ""shareholder value"" but could exercise their discretion for the good of all stakeholders, for instance by increasing wages instead of dividends, or providing services for the good of the community instead of only pursuing profits, if it was in the interests of the enterprise as a whole.[13] However, different states had different corporate laws. To increase revenue from corporate tax, individual states had an incentive to lower their standards in a ""race to the bottom"" to attract corporations to set up their headquarters in the state, particularly where directors controlled the decision to incorporate. ""Charter competition"", by the 1960s, had led Delaware to become home to the majority of the largest US corporations. This meant that the case law of the Delaware Chancery and Supreme Court became increasingly influential. During the 1980s, a huge takeover and merger boom decreased directors' accountability. To fend off a takeover, courts allowed boards to institute ""poison pills"" or ""shareholder rights plans"", which allowed directors to veto any bid â€“ and probably get a payout for letting a takeover happen. More and more people's retirement savings were being invested into the stock market, through pension funds, life insurance and mutual funds. This resulted in a vast growth in the asset management industry, which tended to take control of voting rights. Both the financial sector's share of income, and executive pay for chief executive officers began to rise far beyond real wages for the rest of the workforce. The Enron scandal of 2001 led to some reforms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (on separating auditors from consultancy work). The global financial crisis of 2007 led to minor changes in the Dodd-Frank Act (on soft regulation of pay, alongside derivative markets). However, the basic shape of corporate law in the United States has remained the same since the 1980s.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was intended as a venue for the Oratorio Society of New York and the New York Symphony Society, on whose boards Carnegie served. Construction began in 1890, and was carried out by Isaac A. Hopper and Company. Although the building was in use from April 1891, the official opening night was May 5, with a concert conducted by maestro Walter Damrosch and great Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.[15][16] Originally known simply as ""Music Hall"" (the words ""Music Hall founded by Andrew Carnegie"" still appear on the faÃ§ade above the marquee), the hall was renamed Carnegie Hall in 1893 after board members of the Music Hall Company of New York (the hall's original governing body) persuaded Carnegie to allow the use of his name. Several alterations were made to the building between 1893 and 1896, including the addition of two towers of artists' studios, and alterations to the smaller auditorium on the building's lower level.",NONE,maestro Walter Damrosch and great Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky,,,,,,,,,,,,

2218,Theatre of ancient Greece,what was the purpose of masks in greek theatre,"In a large open-air theatre, like the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, the classical masks were able to create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions.[18] They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character's appearance, e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself.[19] Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as The Furies in Aeschylus' Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides' The Bacchae. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2-3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2221,Currency Act,who was involved in the currency act of 1764,"The Currency Act of 1764 (4 Geo. III c. 34) extended the 1751 Act to all of the British colonies of North America. Unlike the earlier Act, this statute did not prohibit the colonies from issuing paper money, but it did forbid them from designating future currency emissions as legal tender for public and private debts. This tight money policy created financial difficulties in the colonies, where gold and silver were in short supply.[8] Benjamin Franklin, a colonial agent in London, lobbied for repeal of the Act over the next several years,[9] as did other agents. The act arose when Virginia farmers continued to import during the French and Indian War. Virginia issued 250,000 pounds in bills of credit to finance both public and private debts. This legislation differed from the 1751 act in that it prohibited the colonists from designating paper currency for use as payment for any debts, public or private. Parliament did not, however, prohibit the colonists from issuing paper money.[10] The Act was put into place as a hedge against risks associated with economic fluctuations and uncertainty.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2233,Frank Finkel,did anyone survive the battle of little bighorn,"Delia Finkel died in August 1921, shortly after the Walla Walla Bulletin article was published, and in 1926 Frank married his second wife, Hermie. Frank Finkel died at age 76 on August 28, 1930.[2] In 2013, a photograph described as ""August Finckle"" was published first in the ""Battlefield Dispatch,"" a membership-circulation publication for Custer enthusiasts, and then in the December 2013 issue of ""Wild West,"" a professionally edited general-circulation magazine of the Weider History Group. The photograph, described as ""Sergeant August Finckle"" of the Seventh Cavalry in an 1874 cavalry blouse, was widely identified as a photograph of Frank Finkel of Ohio taken 10 years before the familiar Frank Finkel portrait photograph taken around 1886. The hair color and hairline differed due to age, but every facial feature was identical, as were several mannerisms, including the shirt collar flipped up on the right side inside the coat collar, according to Mike Roncallo, a portrait photographer with NJ Press credentials, Sylvia Groen, a portrait painter, Police Chief Benjamin Fox of Wyckoff, NJ, and Jacques Harlow, a professional engineer with a degree from Dartmouth and a Fulbright Scholar with ID training from NYU. The owner of the photograph was a friend of Frank Finckle, fellow soldier and mentions burying Frank Finckle in the same Dispatch article. Four men claimed to identify Finckle and his horse, both dead on Finley Finckle Ridge. They do not name parts of battlefields for missing soldiers. Conversely, Finckle's best friend, Charles Windolph, rode down from Reno Hill expressly to find Finckle's body and give him a decent burial and could not find the body. ""I tried to find the body of my German friend, Trooper Finkle, the tallest man in the regiment, But I could not identify him,"" Windolph, a Medal of Honor recipient and the last living soldier survivor of the battle, said in ""I Fought With Custer."" Windolph's daughter told Dr. Arthur Kannenberg ""After the battle Daddy says he looked everywhere for him as he was like a brother to him -- but the bodies were so disfigured that he was unable to find him."" Dr. Kannenberg showed Windolph a photograph of Frank Finkel as an old man of 66 but Windolph, who was almost blind by that time, could not say whether the photograph resembled Sergeant August Finckle or not. None of the people who claimed to have buried Finckle ever gave a detailed description of how they might have recognized his body. The final report of the primary source, Sergeant Daniel Kanipe, was described as full of inaccuracies by Col. W.A. Graham in ""The Custer Myth."" Kanipe also described 60, 70, or 75 dead Indians when the Indians reported losing only 26 warriors and listed them by name. Kanipe said General Custer was shot once when every other witness said Custer was shot twice. Kanipe failed to identify his own company commander, Tom Custer, who had been beaten to a pulp. Kanipe apparently identified the body of ""Finckle"" for Lt. Edward Godfrey, who did not appear to know Finckle by sight. Sergeant Samuel Alcott was not present at the actual battle and describes the burial he attended as taking place on a ""barren plain"" when it was actually on a hillside. The article in ""Battlefield Dispatch"" also stated that native-born German speakers reported having trouble understanding ""Sergeant Finckle's"" German pronunciation. Author Koster said that this was because Frank Finkel grew up in Ohio, had never lived in Germany, and had learned the Alemannic Bavarian dialect from his immigrant parents.[4]",YES,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was residing in tribal territory, which was outside British control, so Nawab Sahib prevailed upon Sir George Roos-Keppel and the British to permit Haji Sahib to enter British controlled territory for one day so he could lay the foundation stone of Islamia College. The British agreed to this request with the understanding that Haji Sahib would return to tribal territory once he had laid the foundation stone. Haji Sahib was permitted to enter British controlled territory for the ceremony and spent the night in the 'Pokh' Mosque of Tehkal. At the foundation stone laying ceremony, Sir Roos Keppel and other British officials were present, so Haji Sahib hid his face in his sheet (Chadar) from them and was led by Sheikh Muhammad Ibrahim to the place where he was to lay the foundation stone.

In the same year, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war. Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican–American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram, which was intercepted by British Intelligence. Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic. Wilson then asked Congress for ""a war to end all wars"" that would ""make the world safe for democracy"", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917.[6] On December 7, 1917, the U.S. declared war on Austria-Hungary.[7][8] U.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918.

Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions.

2326,Popcorn,who came up with popcorn at the movies,"During the Great Depression, popcorn was fairly inexpensive at 5â€“10 cents a bag and became popular. Thus, while other businesses failed, the popcorn business thrived and became a source of income for many struggling farmers, including the Redenbacher family, namesake of the famous popcorn brand. During World War II, sugar rations diminished candy production, and Americans compensated by eating three times as much popcorn as they had before.[8] The snack was popular at theaters, much to the initial displeasure of many of the theater owners, who thought it distracted from the films. Their minds eventually changed, however, and in 1938 a Midwestern theater owner named Glen W. Dickson installed popcorn machines in the lobbies of his theaters. The venture was a financial success, and the trend soon spread.[5]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2327,ΔF508,what dna changes produce the delta f508 mutation,"The CFTR gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 7, at position q31.2, and ultimately codes for a sequence of 1,480 amino acids. Normally, the three DNA base pairs A-T-C (paired with T-A-G on the opposite strand) at the gene's 507th position form the template for the mRNA codon A-U-C for isoleucine, while the three DNA base pairs T-T-T (paired with A-A-A) at the adjacent 508th position form the template for the codon U-U-U for phenylalanine.[2] The ΔF508 mutation is a deletion of the C-G pair from position 507 along with the first two T-A pairs from position 508, leaving the DNA sequence A-T-T (paired with T-A-A) at position 507, which is transcribed into the mRNA codon A-U-U. Since A-U-U also codes for isoleucine, position 507's amino acid does not change, and the mutation's net effect is equivalent to a deletion (""Δ"") of the sequence resulting in the codon for phenylalanine at position 508.[3]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interstitial and intravascular compartments readily exchange water and solutes but the third extracellular compartment, the transcellular, is thought of as separate from the other two and not in dynamic equilibrium with them.[2]",NONE,"interstitial fluid in the ""interstitial compartment""","blood plasma and lymph in the ""intravascular compartment""","small amounts of transcellular fluid such as ocular and cerebrospinal fluids in the ""transcellular compartment""",,,,,,,,,,

2332,French Revolution,what emperor took over france after the reign of terror,"External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution. The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula, the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine â€“ achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries. Internally, popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly, culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins. The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror, from 1793 until 1794, established price controls on food and other items, abolished slavery in French colonies abroad, dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures, and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies. Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror, with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000.[6] After the Thermidorian Reaction, an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795. The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections, debt repudiations, financial instability, persecutions against the Catholic clergy, and significant military conquests abroad.[7] Dogged by charges of corruption, the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. Napoleon, who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns, went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire, setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars.",NONE,Napoleon Bonaparte,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was recorded on January 25, 1957, and released on the Columbia Records label, over a month later, on March 4.[1] The arranger and recording session conductor was Ray Conniff, an in-house conductor/arranger at Columbia.

2352,Seafloor spreading,where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading,"Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere.The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges.[1] At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm/year.[2]",NONE,volcanic activity,,,,,,,,,,,,

2375,While My Guitar Gently Weeps,who played guitar on my guitar gently weeps,"""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as ""the White Album""). It was written by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist. The song serves as a comment on the disharmony within the Beatles following their return from studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968. This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band's initial apathy towards the composition, which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator, Eric Clapton, to contribute to the recording. Clapton overdubbed a lead guitar part, although he was not formally credited for his contribution.[4]",NONE,George Harrison,Eric Clapton,,,,,,,,,,,

The water has two roles: It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire, and this vapor displaces the oxygen (the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water, at 1,000 °F (538 °C) it expands over 4,000 times). This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent, and it dies out.[16] The vaporization of water also absorbs heat; it thereby cools the smoke, air, walls, and objects that could act as further fuel, and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow, which is by ""jumping"" to nearby heat/fuel sources to start new fires, which then combine. Water extinguishment is thus a combination of ""asphyxia"" (cutting off the oxygen supply) and cooling. The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia, but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area.",NONE,cooling,,,,,,,,,,,,

Centipedes are elongated metameric creatures with one pair of legs per body segment. Centipedes are known to be highly venomous, and often inject paralyzing venom. Despite the name, centipedes can have a varying number of legs, ranging from 30 to 354. Centipedes always have an odd number of pairs of legs.[1][2][3] Therefore, no centipede has exactly 100 legs.

The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species, and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species.[4] Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex, while other axons terminate in the pretectal nucleus and are involved in reflexive eye movements. Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. Its diameter increases from about 1.6 mm within the eye to 3.5 mm in the orbit to 4.5 mm within the cranial space. The optic nerve component lengths are 1 mm in the globe, 24 mm in the orbit, 9 mm in the optic canal, and 16 mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm. There, partial decussation occurs, and about 53% of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts.

The Bonhomme Richard and Serapis entered a bitter engagement at about 6:00 p.m. The battle continued for the next four hours, costing the lives of nearly half of the American and British crews. British victory seemed inevitable, as the more heavily armed Serapis used its firepower to rake Bonhomme Richard with devastating effect. The commander of the Serapis finally called on Jones to surrender. He replied, ""Sir, I have not yet begun to fight!"" Jones eventually managed to lash the ships together, nullifying his opponent's greater maneuverability and allowing him to take advantage of the larger size and considerably more numerous crew of Bonhomme Richard. An attempt by the Americans to board Serapis was repulsed, as was an attempt by the British to board Bonhomme Richard. Finally, after another of Jones's ships joined the fight, the British captain was forced to surrender at about 10:30 p.m. The Bonhomme Richard – shattered, on fire, leaking badly – defied all efforts to save her and sank about 36 hours later at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, 25 September 1779.

K.C., Marisa and the rest of the Coopers flee to a safe house in Rio de Janeiro after Zane and his men target them. After two weeks in the safe house – a run-down apartment – K.C., Ernie and Marisa go into the city to contact The Organization. While in the city, Ernie meets Zoe, a young woman from Kansas who likes him. However, K.C. is suspicious of Zoe and ends their conversation as the Coopers are not to speak to anyone because of the possibility that Zane could be tracking them. K.C. contacts The Organization and learns that Zane is unaware of their whereabouts. K.C. then signs up the family for a mission to capture Passaro Grande, a local smuggler of exotic birds. After capturing Grande, Craig, Kira and Judy take him to the local authorities while K.C., Ernie and Marisa return to the safe house. A strong enemy agent named Sheena, who frequently talks to herself, breaks into the safe house and reveals that she was sent by Zane to kill them. After fighting K.C. and Ernie, Zoe breaks in and knocks out Sheena. Zoe reveals that she is an agent for The Organization who was assigned to protect the family. The group gets into a vehicle to head to a safe location, but K.C. must take a detour through the jungle after learning that Sheena is following them. The next day, Sheena locates the group and incapacitates Ernie, Marisa and Zoe with a small device that electrocutes them. K.C. and Sheena prepare to battle.

During battle, K.C. tosses a Brazilian jumping spider on Sheena to paralyze her. Ernie, Marisa and Zoe regain consciousness and discover that K.C. has also been paralyzed by the spider. They leave Sheena behind and carry K.C. through the jungle. Zoe eventually makes an antidote for K.C. out of jungle vegetation and snake saliva. Meanwhile, Marisa is upset that today is school picture day and she is not there to have her picture taken. Marisa wanted a yearbook picture to remember the fact that she became a high school senior despite her poor grades. After wandering through the jungle, Craig, Kira and Judy find Sheena, who claims to be Zoe. They then find K.C. and the others. K.C. and Zoe apprehend Sheena, and Marisa and the Coopers later board a helicopter. During the flight, Zane reveals himself to be the pilot. Zane destroys the helicopter controls and parachutes out while the helicopter spirals out of control toward the ocean.

The Coopers decide to keep their survival a secret to increase their chances of capturing Zane; they recruit Kira's parents, Othello and Gayle, so they can work together. Disguising her voice as Brett, Judy arranges to meet Zane at a laser tag facility, where K.C. and her family ambush him. After battling with real laser guns, Zane is apprehended, and K.C. declares that they no longer have to worry about The Other Side, unaware that a new enemy organization known as The Alternate has been formed.

K.C. is upset to learn that she has received the same SAT score as Marisa: 1060. K.C. later learns that Beverly had Craig change her SAT result because she received a perfect score. Less than one percent of the population receives a perfect score; leaving the original score intact would draw unnecessary attention to K.C., putting her spy career at risk. K.C. disagrees with Beverly's decision as it will prevent her from being accepted into certain colleges. Beverly tells K.C. that The Organization wants her to remain a spy rather than go to college. K.C. drives to New York to retake her SAT test, while Ernie and Zoe team up for a mission to stop smugglers who are working in a party supplies warehouse. After completing the mission, Ernie asks Zoe to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she has been assigned to a four-year mission in Antarctica. Ernie agrees to wait for Zoe until she concludes her mission. Meanwhile, Marisa wants K.C. to talk to The Organization about letting her become a spy. Marisa is insulted when K.C. tells her that she is not intelligent enough to be a spy. K.C. later tells Marisa that it would be better if she attended college rather than become a spy. Marisa, who does not want to attend college, becomes further upset at K.C. and decides to temporarily end their friendship. Two months later, K.C. learns that she has received a perfect SAT score.

Meanwhile, K.C. misses spending time with Marisa.

K.C. realizes that spending time with Monique is not the same as being with Marisa. Brady assigns Marisa to befriend K.C., who he says could be providing intelligence to The Other Side.

K.C. is assigned to go undercover as a construction worker at a tall unfinished building, allowing her to spy on a nearby tower where a group of renegade spies are believed to be meeting so they can discuss weapons. K.C.'s male co-workers at the construction site mock her for being a female. K.C. meets a female construction worker, Crystal, who tells K.C. that the men will eventually ignore her. K.C. later learns that the renegade spy group is working on sonic brain imploders, capable of melting people's brains. When Brady has Marisa gain knowledge about K.C.'s current mission, he warns his group that K.C. is spying on them and that she must be killed. A man is sent to the construction site to plant a brain imploder device. After a fight, K.C. takes down the man, but he says he does not know how to diffuse the imploder. Crystal has K.C. put the imploder into cement mix, which prevents it from detonating. Meanwhile, Judy gets in trouble at school after using mature logic to question a student's belief in the tooth fairy. Ernie is tasked with teaching Judy to behave like a normal child, to help maintain her cover as a spy robot.

Ernie and Marisa mock K.C., believing that she does not have a date for their final high school homecoming. On the night of the homecoming, K.C. goes on a mission to retrieve a weather-altering device known as the Storm Maker, which the remaining members of The Other Side plan to use to create man-made weather disasters. K.C. retrieves the device and hides it in her school locker, where she plans to keep it while she attends the homecoming. K.C. has Howard, a gadget inventor for The Organization, pose as her date at homecoming, telling him that it is actually practice so he can become a field agent. Marisa attends homecoming with Brady, while Ernie goes with Monique. Brady learns about the Storm Maker through Marisa after having her casually question K.C. about her latest mission. Brady, who is working for The Alternate, steals the device and places it in his locker, then deletes security footage of his theft before K.C. and Ernie can learn who took the device. Meanwhile, Craig and Judy attend a father-daughter dance at her school.

K.C. and Craig discover that the Storm Maker device cannot be powered without a rare chemical known as Dilithium. They go undercover as workers at a truck stop restaurant so they can obtain the Dilithium from a truck that is delivering it. Meanwhile, Ernie gives Judy an emotion upgrade to increase her mental sensitivity, to help her maintain her cover as a real child. At school, Ernie overhears Brady during a phone conversation and discovers that he is an enemy agent. Brady uses memory spray to erase Ernie's recent memory. Marisa visits the house to ask Ernie questions regarding K.C.'s latest mission. Ernie then overhears Marisa talking to Brady on a cellular phone, and learns that she is a spy. Marisa erases his recent memories with memory spray. At the truck stop, the driver of the Dilithium truck walks inside for lunch, allowing K.C. to obtain the chemicals. Brady, wearing a ski mask, takes the Dilithium and hijacks the truck. K.C. attempts to take control of the truck, and scratches part of Brady's face through the mask opening, before falling off the truck. Later, K.C. meets Marisa and Brady at a restaurant, and notices the scratch marks on his face. Although he says the marks came from a cat, K.C. realizes that Brady was the truck hijacker.

K.C. suspects that Brady has been spying on her through a necklace that he gave Marisa, who is unaware of Brady's Storm Maker theft. K.C. believes the necklace is bugged, so she creates a plan to trick and catch Brady. K.C. tells Marisa, who is wearing the necklace, that The Organization has created a device called the Rain Coat, capable of stopping the Storm Maker. K.C. also says that she will be dropping off the plans for the device – which is actually fictitious – in an alley later that night, with the hope that Brady will arrive there to steal them. A masked man from The Alternate arrives to intercept the plans, but he is knocked out by K.C., who realizes that the man is not Brady. Three additional masked men arrive, including Brady, but they are forced away when Marisa arrives and threatens them with a laser gun. Meanwhile, Kira is about to enjoy a day off when Lori, an agent of The Organization, drops off her baby at the Coopers' house so she can go on a last-minute mission. Kira then puts Judy in charge of watching the baby, claiming that she has to go on a last-minute mission. Kira actually gets a massage and has her nails done, while Judy is unable to stop the baby from crying.

Agent Johnson puts the Coopers in charge of collecting information on Brady. K.C. arranges a job interview for Marisa to become a junior agent-in-training for The Organization, which leads Marisa to question Brady, who had already told her that she was a junior agent. After being questioned, Brady eventually reveals to Marisa that he is a member of The Alternate. Brady also reveals that he has hours of audio footage in which Marisa states that K.C. may have become a rogue agent and agrees to work with him to take her down. Brady blackmails Marisa to continue spying on K.C., or else he will release the audio footage and get her imprisoned for treason against the United States. Marisa confesses to K.C. that she has been spying for Brady, and K.C. discovers that Marisa's necklace was never bugged. When unusual weather begins occurring around the world, the Coopers realize that the Storm Maker has been activated, so they instruct Marisa to gain information from Brady about the device. When Marisa fails, K.C. goes in disguise as Marisa and confronts Brady, who kidnaps and takes her to The Alternate's headquarters, as she planned. Meanwhile, Ernie wants to drive by Monique's house in his father's 1969 classic muscle car, but he crashes it before getting out of the driveway, scraping away the paint on one of the doors. Judy makes the situation worse by repainting the door a different color and then removing the paint entirely. Ernie and Judy blame the damage on The Alternate, but Craig does not believe them.

K.C. frees an imprisoned scientist named Gwen, who leads her through the building in search of the Storm Maker, but Gwen later reveals she is part of The Alternate. Brady, Gwen, and Alternate member Reid plan to use the Storm Maker to have a massive storm hit the Capitol Building during the State of the Union address. Craig and Kira drive to the Capitol to warn people, but they encounter heavy rain and hail. Marisa enters The Alternate's headquarters to help K.C., and they rush to the rooftop to destroy the Storm Maker's transmitter. After a brawl with Brady, K.C. destroys the transmitter with a laser gun. Brady escapes by parachuting off the rooftop, and Marisa decides that she does not want to interview to become a spy because of the hard work required by the job.

Judy's memory is almost full, which requires her to visit The Organization to have her video footage downloaded. The Coopers realize that Judy has recorded everything they have done, including things that could get them excluded from The Organization again. The family decides to delete Judy's incriminating videos, including footage showing that Marisa knows about the family being spies. After reminiscing through old footage, Craig deletes several videos, including important footage from their recent circus mission. When the family discovers that the circus footage cannot be recovered, they worry about how Agent Johnson will react to them tampering with evidence. Ernie suggests reenacting the circus mission in their house and filming it to cover for the deletion of the real footage, which leads the family to reminisce through old videos about his previous bad ideas. The family also watches other old videos, until Agent Johnson arrives at the house to pick up Judy. The family hides Judy and convinces Johnson that she has already left to visit The Organization for the memory download. Afterwards, Judy expresses sorrow that her videos will need to be downloaded and removed, as they serve as her memories. Ernie devises a solution to back up Judy's video footage to a separate hard drive so they can be reinstalled onto Judy after she downloads them for The Organization.

Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions, because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate. Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud.

In spot-type detectors all of these components are arranged inside a chamber where air, which may contain smoke from a nearby fire, flows. In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums, optical beam or projected-beam smoke detectors are used instead of a chamber within the unit: a wall-mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device, or reflected back to the receiver by a reflector. In some types, particularly optical beam types, the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the photosensor. The received light intensity will be reduced due to scattering from particulates of smoke, air-borne dust, or other substances; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold, potentially due to smoke.[26] In other types, typically chamber types, the light is not directed at the sensor, which is not illuminated in the absence of particles. If the air in the chamber contains particles (smoke or dust), the light is scattered and some of it reaches the sensor, triggering the alarm.[26]",NONE,"photoelectric, or optical smoke detector",,,,,,,,,,,,

2590,Commonwealth of Nations,why is ireland not a member of the commonwealth,"On 18 April 1949, Ireland formally became a republic in accordance with the Irish Republic of Ireland Act 1948. Because it did this, it was automatically excluded from the Commonwealth. While Ireland had not actively participated in the Commonwealth since the early 1930s and was content to leave the Commonwealth, other dominions wished to become republics without losing Commonwealth ties. The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a Commonwealth prime ministers' meeting in London. Under the London Declaration, India agreed that, when it became a republic in January 1950, it would accept the British Sovereign as a ""symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth"". Upon hearing this, King George VI told the Indian politician Krishna Menon: ""So, I've become 'as such'"".[26] The other Commonwealth countries recognised India's continuing membership of the association. At Pakistan's insistence, India was not regarded as an exceptional case and it was assumed that other states would be accorded the same treatment as India.[citation needed]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parsons and Frank L. Stulen. The first commercial, digital and programmable robot was built by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate.

2595,South Pole,where is south pole located on a map,"The Geographic South Pole is located on the continent of Antarctica (although this has not been the case for all of Earth's history because of continental drift). It sits atop a featureless, barren, windswept and icy plateau at an altitude of 2,835 metres (9,301 ft) above sea level, and is located about 1,300 km (800 mi) from the nearest open sea at Bay of Whales. The ice is estimated to be about 2,700 metres (9,000 ft) thick at the Pole, so the land surface under the ice sheet is actually near sea level.[2]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide, France fashioned a semi-independent State of Vietnam, within the French Union, with Bảo Đại as Head of State. Meanwhile, as the Communists under Mao Zedong took over China, the Viet Minh began to receive military aid from China. Beside supplying materials, Chinese cadres also pressured the Vietnamese Communist Party, then under First Secretary Trường Chinh, to emulate their brand of revolution, unleashing a purge of ""bourgeois and feudal"" elements from the Viet Minh ranks, carrying out a ruthless and bloody land reform campaign (Cải Cách Ruộng Đất), and denouncing ""bourgeois and feudal"" tendencies in arts and literature. Many true patriots and devoted Communist revolutionaries in the Viet Minh suffered mistreatment or were even executed during these movements. Many others became disenchanted and left the Viet Minh.

September 24, 2017 (2017-09-24)[a]


Investigating a damaged satellite near a binary star system on the edge of Federation space, the crew members of the USS Shenzhou discover an object obscured from their sensors. After First Officer Michael Burnham volunteers to investigate the object, she finds an ancient, carved vessel. She is attacked by a Klingon, and when trying to escape, she accidentally kills him. A group of Klingons mourn the death of their soldier, dubbed the ""Torchbearer"", before the outcast Voq volunteers to take his place. The Klingons, led by T'Kuvma, reveal themselves in a cloakable ship. T'Kuvma preaches to his followers of the Federation's attempts to usurp the individuality of the Klingons and their culture, and plans to fulfill an ancient prophecy by uniting the 24 great Klingon houses as was once done by Kahless. Voq activates a beacon that summons the Klingon leaders. Burnham, desperate to prevent a war, attempts to fire on the Klingons first, against the wishes of Captain Philippa Georgiou. Burnham is arrested for mutiny.

T'Kuvma convinces the majority of the Klingon leaders that he can lead them to victory over the Federation, as reinforcements for the Shenzhou arrive. Georgiou offers to resolve the situation peacefully, but the Klingons immediately open fire. Starfleet Admiral Anderson arrives and again offers peace to the Klingons, but his ship is rammed by another cloaked Klingon vessel. Anderson has his ship self-destruct, destroying the Klingon ship as well. Starfleet retreats, leaving the Klingons to collect their dead. In the remains of the Shenzhou, Burnham escapes her cell after encouragement from her guardian Sarek via a telepathic connection. She convinces Georgiou to try to take T'Kuvma prisoner, and they create a distraction by sending an explosive into his ship with a Klingon corpse. Boarding the vessel, Burnham overpowers Voq. Georgiou attempts to capture T'Kuvma, but is killed. T'Kuvma is fatally shot by Burnham, who is transported to safety. Voq promises that T'Kuvma's legacy will live on. Burnham is later sentenced to life in prison for her mutiny.

Six months into her sentence, Burnham is on an unexpected prison transfer when an emergency forces her shuttle to be rescued by the USS Discovery. Spending several days on the ship, Burnham is ordered by its captain, the mysterious Gabriel Lorca, to assist with a scientific assignment. Burnham overhears Lieutenant Paul Stamets, an astromycologist who is leading the assignment, discuss an upcoming experiment with a colleague serving on another starship; Lorca is soon informed of an incident on the Discovery's sister ship, the USS Glenn, that has killed the entire crew. Stamets leads a boarding party to investigate and finds the dead crew hideously twisted and malformed, as well as a group of Klingons killed by an unknown creature. Lorca later asks Burnham to work for him, despite her sentence, explaining that he organized the circumstances that led her to him so she could help develop a new spore-based propulsion system that could win the war she started by killing T'Kuvma. He also secretly has the creature transported aboard the Discovery.

Lorca assigns Burnham to study the creature from the Glenn, dubbed a Tardigrade, to find a way to use its biology as a weapon. Starfleet orders Discovery to the dilithium mining colony Corvan II, which is under Klingon attack. Stamets is reluctant to make such a long jump using the spores, and when the drive is activated the ship nearly collides with a star. Lorca sends Commander Landry to keep Burnham's research on track, and she attempts to sedate the Tardigrade (that she names Ripper) to cut off its claw; it kills her. Burnham believes that Ripper was acting in self-defense, and is drawn to the spores. Stamets and Burnham transport it to Engineering, where it connects to the spore drive and interfaces with the navigation system. The ship successfully makes the jump to Corvan II and saves the colony. On T'Kuvma's stranded ship, Klingon leader Kol earns the loyalty of T'Kuvma's desperate followers, and leaves Voq to die in the wreckage of the Shenzhou. L'Rell, secretly loyal to Voq, promises a way for them to win the war for the house of T'Kuvma.

After a month of successful operations, Lorca is ordered to protect the spore drive until it can be replicated for other Starfleet ships. As he returns to the Discovery, Lorca is taken captive by the Klingons. Burnham has grown concerned with the toll that the drive has taken on Ripper. Along with Stamets' partner, medical officer Hugh Culber, Burnham convinces Stamets to find an alternative to run the drive. Lorca is imprisoned with captured Starfleet officer Ash Tyler and human criminal Harry Mudd, and in discussions Lorca reveals that he killed his entire crew during an earlier battle to spare them from the Klingons' torture, but escaped himself. Lorca is tortured by L'Rell, who wants the secret behind Discovery's new form of travel, but Lorca and Tyler escape before the Klingons learn anything. For the final jump needed to escape the Klingons, with Lorca and Tyler on-board, Stamets connects to the spore drive himself using Ripper's DNA. Later, Burnham frees Ripper, while Stamets' reflection does not walk away from a mirror when he does.

On his way to broker a peace deal with renegade Klingon houses, Sarek is injured when a ""logic extremist"" attempts to assassinate him. Burnham senses this, and Lorca agrees to rescue Sarek. Admiral Katrina Cornwell questions this decision and others that Lorca has been making. Burnham searches for Sarek in a shuttle with her roommate, Cadet Sylvia Tilly, and Tyler. Burnham attempts to connect with Sarek's mind, and finds him remembering the time that her application for the Vulcan Expeditionary Group was rejected. She learns that the VEG would only admit one of Sarek's children, and he chose Spock, his half-human son. Spock ultimately chose to join Starfleet, rendering Sarek's decision futile. Burnham helps him regain consciousness and activate a locator beacon. Lorca and Cornwell sleep together, but she is concerned by his paranoid behavior and plans to remove him from command of Discovery. With Sarek unable to meet the Klingons, Cornwell takes his place; however, the peace talks are actually a trap, and she is taken captive.

While attending a crew party, Burnham and Tyler are called to the bridge to deal with an endangered space creature that the Discovery has come across. When the creature is brought on board, it is revealed to be carrying a person: Harry Mudd. He plans to kill Lorca and sell the ship to the Klingons, but when he is caught he blows up the ship instead. Time returns to the party earlier, with Burnham and Tyler called to the bridge again. They are intercepted by Stamets, who is aware that they are in a time loop due to his interactions with Ripper. Over several time loops Stamets works with Burnham and Tyler to find a solution to the problem while Mudd gets further in his plan each time. They eventually convince Mudd that he has won, and he ends the time loop. Preparing to receive a boarding party of Klingons, Mudd is instead confronted by his ""beloved"" Stella and her father, from whom he had stolen her dowry. They take Mudd away. Stamets reveals to Burnham and Tyler that in one of the time loops they had danced together and kissed.

Coming to the aid of another Federation ship, the Discovery is unable to prevent its destruction from a Klingon ship with their cloaking technology. Desperate for a way to detect these ships even when they are cloaked, Burnham, Tyler, and Saru are sent to Pahvo, a seemingly uninhabited planet with a naturally occurring crystalline transmitter that broadcasts the planet's vibrational frequency into space. They hope to use the transmitter to create a sonar for the hidden Klingon ships. They discover that Pahvo is inhabited with indigenous life that introduce Saru to their higher understanding of peace, and he attempts to force Burnham and Tyler to remain with him on the planet forever. Burnham is able to fight off Saru and broadcast the new signal. However, the Pahvo lifeforms adjust the signal to contact the Klingons as well, hoping to end the war. Kol receives the signal, after sentencing L'Rell to death: she had tried to help Cornwell escape in exchange for protection from Kol, leading to L'Rell apparently killing Cornwell to try save face with Kol.

Lorca is ordered to flee before the Klingons arrive, but disobeys orders to protect the lifeforms on Pahvo and their chances of detecting the cloaked ships. When the Klingons arrive, Tyler and Burnham transport to their ship and plant sensors that will help create an algorithm for detecting the cloaked ships. They find an alive Cornwell hidden with L'Rell, but encountering the latter sends Tyler into shock due to PTSD from her torturing and raping him. Lorca has Stamets make 133 micro-jumps in order to provide a three-dimensional reading of the sensors, while Burnham distracts Kol by challenging him to a fight. The jumps are completed, though not without trauma to Stamets. When the algorithm is calculated, Burnham, Tyler, Cornwell, and L'Rell (who wishes to defect) are transported back to the Discovery and the Klingon ship is destroyed. Stamets volunteers to make one more jump to safety, but tells Lorca it will be his last. However, Lorca changes the coordinates and they jump to an unknown destination surrounded by debris from Klingon ships.

Discovery's crew determines that they have arrived in a parallel Mirror Universe, with Stamets now unconscious and unable to power the spore drive. Tyler confronts L'Rell, and she attempts to use a verbal cue to trigger something within him, though he fights this off. From a data core from a wrecked Klingon ship, they learn that this universe is ruled by the human Terran Empire, who are fighting a resistance that includes species such as Klingons and Vulcans. Here, Burnham is the former captain of the ISS Shenzhou, presumed dead after an attack by the fugitive Lorca. The ISS Discovery is captained by Silvia Tilly's counterpart, so she and the crew pretend to be their Mirror selves. They deliver Burnham and Lorca to the Shenzhou, under the ruse that Burnham had been hunting Lorca since her presumed death and had now captured him. Tyler accompanies them, after first killing Culber when he informs Tyler that he appears to have undergone major surgical modifications. On the Shenzhou, Lorca is tortured while Burnham assumes command.

The ISS Shenzhou is given the coordinates of the resistance leadership, and ordered to kill them all. Burnham and Tyler travel as a landing party themselves and instead surrender to the resistance in hopes of learning how the Klingons of this universe have learned to work with other species; they find that the Mirror Voq is the leader. Burnham offers to give the group time to escape before their base is destroyed, and Mirror Sarek confirms she can be trusted after connecting to her mind. Listening to Voq triggers Tyler's programming, and he has to be restrained. Back on the ship, he reveals to Burnham that he now knows he was once Voq, and that he underwent surgery to appear human and infiltrate Starfleet. She has him beamed into space, where he is picked up by the USS Discovery. Saru and Tilly imprison him, having earlier found the body of Culber, and apparently failed to heal Stamets using spores. Burnham is reprimanded for not killing the resistance leaders immediately by the Emperor—the Mirror Georgiou.

Burnham and Lorca are summoned to the ISS Charon, the imperial flagship. Georgiou sends Lorca to a torturous agony booth, and has dinner with Burnham. Stamets finds himself within the mycelial network with the consciousness of his Mirror counterpart, learning that the network has been corrupted by the Mirror Stamets' experiments. Stamets encounters a representation of Culber and accepts his loss, before waking up to find his spore collection infected. Georgiou laments allowing Lorca to become a father figure for Burnham, only for the pair to fall in love and plot to overthrow her. She plans to execute Burnham, who reveals the truth about being from another universe. Explaining how they had crossed over, Georgiou trades the spore drive's schematics for information on alternative ways to cross between universes, which leads Burnham to realize that the Lorca she knows is actually from the Mirror Universe, and has been manipulating events to get close to her and back to the Mirror Universe. Lorca escapes from the agony booth.

Writing in 1861, the influential British philosopher and economist, John Stuart Mill stated in Utilitarianism his view that ""Society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice; towards which all institutions, and the efforts of all virtuous citizens, should be made in the utmost degree to converge.""[25]",NONE,the 1840s,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amy is set to call Bernadette but once Penny realizes Amy is her best friend, she immediately pitches herself for the position and Amy enthusiastically chooses her. Amy later makes Penny tell Bernadette the bad news.

Title reference: Sheldon and Amy scoring their friends for roles in the wedding.

2612,The Star-Spangled Banner,when did it become law to stand for the national anthem,"The text of 36 U.S.C. § 301 is suggestive and not regulatory in nature. Failure to follow the suggestions is not a violation of law. This behavioral requirement for the national anthem is subject to the same First Amendment controversies that surround the Pledge of Allegiance.[62] For example, Jehovah's Witnesses do not sing the national anthem, though they are taught that standing is an ""ethical decision"" that individual believers must make based on their ""conscience.""[63][64][65]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rowling. It is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, first published in 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by Scholastic Corporation in 1998. The plot follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage as he makes close friends and a few enemies in his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

2649,Gregor Mendel,who is the father of genetics and what did he study,"Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed that when a true-breeding yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring always produced yellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this phenomenon, Mendel coined the terms “recessive” and “dominant” in reference to certain traits. (In the preceding example, the green trait, which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation, is recessive and the yellow is dominant.) He published his work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible “factors”—now called genes—in predictably determining the traits of an organism.",NONE,Mendel,pea plants,,,,,,,,,,,

After the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the transfer of India from the East India Company to the British Empire (the Raj), it was the goal of the Raj to support and justify its governance of India with the aid of English-educated Indians, who would be familiar and friendly to British culture and political thinking. Ironically, a few of the reasons the Congress grew and survived in the era of undisputed British hegemony, was through the patronage of British authorities, Anglo-Indians, and a rising Indian, English language educated, class.[citation needed]",NONE,Retired British ICS officer Allan Octavian Hume,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alliance sailed past and fired a broadside, doing at least as much damage to Richard as to Serapis.

After being shot, Fred is rushed to the hospital by Archie, who is soon joined by his friends. Sheriff Keller gains a description of the shooter from Archie and calls him in for a lineup, but none of the men in the lineup are the shooter. When Veronica searches Fred's belongings, Archie sees that his wallet is missing. Betty and Jughead visit Pop's to look for the wallet but find nothing; instead, they learn from Pop that the shooter did not take any money from the register, meaning that it was actually a hit against Fred. Jughead asks the Southside Serpents to investigate the shooting, but to no avail. Veronica accuses Hermione of hiring a hitman to kill Fred, but she vehemently denies this and tensions develop between them when Veronica is not sure of her mother is telling the truth. Meanwhile, Cheryl intimidates Penelope—who suffers severe burns due to the fire at their mansion and is hospitalized—into lying that it was an accident. Fred survives his shooting. Hiram returns to Riverdale, further escalating the tensions in the Lodge family. In the nearby town of Greendale, Ms. Grundy is strangled to death by Fred's shooter.

After learning of Ms. Grundy's murder, an increasingly anxious Archie suspects that her death is connected with Fred's shooting, which pushes him to get a gun from Dilton Doiley. Following the shooting, business at Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe has declined, leading Pop to consider selling the diner, but Betty convinces Pop to let her throw a retro fun night to drum up business. Jughead learns that F.P. is facing 20 years in prison and seeks help from Penny Peabody, a Serpent lawyer, who advises Jughead to ask the Blossoms to testify on F.P.'s behalf. Cheryl initially refuses, but relents when Betty extorts her with the video of Jason's murder. With Cheryl's testimony, the judge decides to revisit F.P's sentence. Hiram quietly buys the diner from Pop, but tells Veronica he made a ""charitable donation"". In the woods, Moose Mason and Midge Klump take some jingle jangle (a new drug to Riverdale), and as they do so, they are shot by Fred's shooter.

Meanwhile, Jughead begins his tenure at Southside High, befriends Toni Topaz, a Serpent, and refounds the school newspaper, the Red and Black, under the advisory of English teacher Robert Philips. Kevin keeps going out late at night, which concerns Betty. Betty follows him on one of his runs, which leads to him lashing out at her.

Pickens' Day, a day in remembrance of Riverdale's founder, nears. Adams tells Archie to get close to Hiram. With Veronica's urging, he tries out for the wrestling team in order to impress Hiram, a former wrestler. This, however, causes tension between the two to rise. Betty learns that Chic is a webcam model, and attempts to reach out to him, talking about her 'dark side'. Mayor McCoy organizes the Pickens' Day festival, which the Lodges attempt to spin as a festival with North/Southside unity, with the Serpents as security. Jughead interviews Toni's grandfather for a school project, learning that Toni's grandfather was a member of a Native American tribe which was slaughtered by Pickens. Jughead publishes this story as an article, escalting tensions with the two sides. Tensions arise between Veronica and Josie, with McCoy driving a wedge between the two. At the Pickens Day fest, the Serpents protest the event, but Hiram spins their words positively. That night, Archie meets with Hiram, who offers Archie his business tutelage, which Archie accepts. The next morning, McCoy, Sheriff Keller, and the Lodges meet at the statue of Pickens, which has been decapitated. They decide to blame the desecration on the Serpents.

The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow.

Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed a printing system, by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. In East Asia, where it was invented, the usefulness of movable type was limited by the complexity of the writing system and, without the hand mould, the production of sorts (individual letters of type) was slow.

The exteriors of Kubrick's Overlook were supplied by the Timberline Lodge on the slopes of Mt. Hood in Oregon. Inspiration for the interior sets (erected at Elstree Studios in England) came from the 1927 Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park.

These devices may have been crude harps or it may be that the harp developed from the use of triangles to distinguish Irish coins.[6] The idea of a harp being the arms of Ireland may have originated as a reference to a fictional character, le roi d'irelande, in the courtly legend cycle of Tristan. Alternatively, it may have derived from a celebrated 13th century bardic poem, Tabhroidh Chugam Cruit mo Riogh, dedicated to the Donnchadh Cairbreach O'Briain (d. 1242), a Gaelic King of Thomond.[7]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Let's Do It, Zen-Oh Sama! The All-Universe Martial Arts Tournament!!""

February 5, 2017

The Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō are playing a game together in their realm, but both have become bored with their monotonous routine. Meanwhile, Goku heads to a local farmer's market to sell his produce and get Chi-Chi off his back about making money. On the way home, he is ambushed by some robbers. Goku defeats them, but he is injured in the process. Deciding that he has grown rusty, Goku and Goten decide to train with Whis. They head to the Capsule Corporation building, where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta's second child. Goten remains behind to train with Trunks. Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth. Goku heads to Beerus' planet alone. While training with Whis, Goku remembers Grand Zenō's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament. Heedless of Beerus and Whis' warnings, Goku uses Grand Zenō's button to head to his realm and convinces Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament. When he returns to Beerus' planet, Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Grand Zenō naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse. Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again. Goku, Beerus, and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais, where the Grand Minister arrives. He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the ""Tournament of Power"" (力の大会, Chikara no Taikai).

The Grand Minister explains the details of the ""Tournament of Power"" and states that it will be held on ""the World of Void"". It is a place of ""infinite nothingness"", where the competitors can fight without limits. The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls, while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence. Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty. Goku suggests asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to ignore it, but Whis advises against this. Whis tells Goku that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous. Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament in the first place. Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces. The Grand Minister also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Grand Zenō's benefit. Each universe is to name three fighters. Goku sets off to recruit teammates. After Vegeta refuses, Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu, who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7. Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan. Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic. Back at Grand Zenō's and Future Grand Zenō's palace, all the gods from all 12 universes gather. The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match. He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament. In the first round, Majin Buu is to fight Basil (バジル, Bajiru), a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9.

Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh (ロウ, Rō), the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender (ラベンダ, Rabenda) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match. Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender.

As their battle begins, Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan's eyes and blinds him. Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison, but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone. Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he cannot continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie. After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean, the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well. However, Universes 1, 5, 8, and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong. Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had long believed that there were too many universes. He was planning to erase most of them anyway, but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared. With the announcement concluded, the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo (ベルガモ, Berugamo), Basil's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine.

Before their battle begins, Bergamo denounces Goku before the assembled gods. Bergamo pleads with Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased. Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō agree on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle. Grand Minister states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō will immediately erase all of the universes. Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms. When the fight begins, Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed. Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times, but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku's attacks. He grows stronger and physically larger. Goku continues to attack, which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight. Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue, which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha. Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure, but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge. The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin. The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner. Suddenly, a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo (トッポ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle. Goku, who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo, agrees to fight Toppo.

After obtaining Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō blessing to proceed, Goku and Toppo begin their battle. Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku's shoulder. Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows, but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug. He begins squeezing the life out of Goku, which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape. Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha. Just as the two power up even more, the Grand Minister puts an end to the fight. As Toppo leaves, he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren (ジレン). The Grand Minister begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power. In the Sacred World of the Kais, Beerus and Goku get into an argument over Goku's constant relaxed and negligent attitude, which Whis breaks up. The group agrees to convene at the Capsule Corporation to discuss their future strategy.

Goku and the others arrive at Capsule Corporation. They discuss who should be on the team. Goku immediately suggests Monaka, but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and cannot participate. Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta, Piccolo, Krillin, Master Roshi, No. 18, and No. 17, which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine. Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience. They proceed to ask Vegeta, who has been thinking of a name for his second child. Vegeta refuses to participate. He says he will not fight, while Bulma is pregnant. Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight. Everyone celebrates the baby's birth. Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother. As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta, he develops an attachment to her. Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot. However, Vegeta quickly accepts Bulla's name. Goku leaves to recruit members and heads to Krillin's house.

Goku and Gohan arrive at Krillin's house and ask him and No. 18 to join the Tournament of Power. No. 18 convinces Krillin to participate in order to put his newfound martial arts training to use. No. 18 is reluctant to join herself. She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them, but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward, which convinces her to participate. Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast. After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat, Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea. Goku is excited by Krillin's new power. He challenges him to a sparring match as well. They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan, where Krillin's strategies make up for the gap in power, forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan. Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form, and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash. As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin, No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku's Kamehameha, just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion. She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku cannot expect to fight one-on-one all the time. Goku concedes the match and realizes he will have to adjust his tactics in order to win the Tournament of Power. No. 18 reveals that No. 17 is currently working at a wildlife reserve, but she does not know where. Goku decides to ask Dende to find No. 17.

Goku discovers that Buu has lost weight and has gotten much slimmer in appearance. The two spar together. Buu defeats Goku by overwhelming him with ki blasts and knocking him out of the fighting stage. Meanwhile, Khai (カイ), the Supreme Kai of Universe 11, gathers all of the Supreme Kais involved in the tournament except for Universe 7's, who is ostracized due to Goku's involvement with the creation of the tournament. Khai asks his fellow Supreme Kais to request that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō cancel the erasure of the universes, but they are all too afraid of his wrath to do so. Champa gathers all the Gods of Destruction involved in the tournament except Beerus after finding out about the Supreme Kai's meeting, and they discuss Goku. Toppo recruits his fellow Pride Troopers Kahseral (カーセラル, Kāseraru) and Dyspo (ディスポ, Disupo). Champa recruits Cabba and demands he find more powerful Saiyans.

On their way to the island where No. 17 is working, Dende explains that since the conclusion of the Cell Games, No. 17 has started a family and gotten far stronger. Dende also reveals that Kid Buu has reincarnated as a young Earthling with massive fighting potential and asks Goku to train him when he is old enough. They reach the island as Goku arrives just in time to witness No. 17 defeat a group of armed poachers. As they introduce themselves to each other, a large army of poachers arrive. Goku and No. 17 team up to subdue them all. Afterwards, No. 17 explains that the poachers are after the last Minotaurus in order to steal its rare and valuable horns. The two decide to have a sparring match. No. 17 evenly matches Super Saiyan Goku, which causes him to turn Super Saiyan Blue. Goku launches a Kamehameha at No. 17, who easily deflects it with an energy shield. The two go toe-to-toe until No. 17 ends the match in order to avoid catching the island in the crossfire. Goku and No. 17 acknowledge that they were both holding back in the fight. Afterwards, Goku attempts to convince him to join the Tournament of Power, but No. 17 is uninterested. He remains indifferent even when Goku reveals that the losing universes will be erased. Meanwhile, alien poachers arrive on Earth and they set their sights on the Minotaurus.

After defeating some of the poachers, No. 17 sets off to defeat the leader, while Goku remains behind to battle the rest of the poachers. No. 17 confronts and easily defeats the leader. Goku catches up just as the leader pulls out a switch and threatens to self-destruct if he is not released immediately. No. 17 smashes him out of a window, which vents both of them into deep space. Goku manages to use his Instant Transmission to teleport all three of them to King Kai's world. Dende contacts Goku and informs him that the leader's threat was a bluff. Afterwards, Goku and No. 17 return the animals to their rightful homes. Jaco arrives to arrest the alien poachers.

Piccolo explains that Goku has already informed him about the potential erasure of the universe and that he is going to participate in the Tournament of Power. He points out that Gohan's over eagerness to protect his loved ones is making him reckless. Gohan transforms into a Super Saiyan, and the two continue to spar. Meanwhile, Cabba heads to the residence of his retired captain and mentor, Renso (レンソウ).

Back in Universe 7, Piccolo removes his weighted clothes to go all out and quickly defeats Gohan. Piccolo explains that Gohan has a tendency to become arrogant when he has the advantage in battle. After being encouraged by Piccolo, Gohan manages to reach the level of power he had against Super Buu. The two fight again, and Gohan successfully severs Piccolo's arm. However, Piccolo blasts him in the back with the severed arm and defeats Gohan, which proves Piccolo's point about Gohan's overconfidence.

Goku heads to Master Roshi's island, where Oolong informs him that Tien and Chiaotzu have started a martial arts dojo, and that Roshi has headed there to act as a special instructor. Goku decides to make Tien the tenth member of the team, and heads off to recruit him and Roshi. At Tien's dojo, a woman named Yurin (ユーリン, Yūrin) with a grudge against Tien arrives and requests to join the dojo. Although Tien denies her because her motivation of beauty was unfit for his dojo, Roshi drags Yurin off to ogle her. Goku arrives and asks Tien to join the Tournament of Power, but, even after Goku bribes him with 10 million Zeni, Tien refuses. Yurin escapes Roshi's advances and uses witchcraft to drive Tien's students on a rampage throughout town. Goku, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Roshi arrive at the village, where Yurin confronts them. Yurin explains that she is a former classmate of Tien's during his time at the Crane School and that she swore revenge on him after he left the school and refused to fight her. Meanwhile, Cabba sways Caulifla into joining Universe 6's team by promising to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan. Back on Earth, while Goku, Chiaotzu, and Tien cure the students of their brainwashing, Roshi battles Yurin. He lowers his guard after catching a glimpse of Yurin's panties, which allows her to brainwash him. The brainwashed Roshi quickly defeats Tien, but Goku intervenes. While Chiaotzu temporarily disables Yurin, Goku subdues Roshi with a Kamehameha and cures him of the brainwashing. Tien orders Yurin to apologize to everyone she hurt and offers her a place at his dojo. Tien decides to join the Tournament of Power because he believes that the 10 million Zeni Goku promised will repair the village.

Although Tien views this as a practice match and wants to avoid injuring anyone, Gohan and Goku take the fight seriously. As Gohan fights both his father and Tien, Piccolo spends the time charging a strong technique, which ultimately destroys the mountain fighting stage when it is launched. Tien calls the match off on the grounds that the fighting stage is now destroyed. Although Goku agrees, Gohan requests to have a one-on-one fight against his father. Goku accepts, and Gohan powers up while Goku goes Super Saiyan 2. Although Goku has the upper hand for much of the fight, Gohan turns the tables and begins to overpower Goku. Gohan begs Goku to use his full power. Goku responds by becoming a Super Saiyan Blue and using his Kaio-Ken technique, then defeats Gohan with a single blow. Impressed with his son's improvement, Goku assigns Gohan as the leader of their Universe 7 team. Meanwhile, Rumsshi (ラムーシ, Ramūshi) recruits a powerful fighter named Murichim (ムリチム, Murichimu) and his companions to represent Universe 10 in the tournament.

After Krillin brings up the 10 million Zeni prize that Goku had bribed him, Piccolo and Gohan reveal to Krillin, No. 18, and Tien that the prize of 10 million Zeni was a lie and that the universe will be erased if they lose. When Goku returns, Krillin berates him and threatens to withdraw from the team along with No. 18. After Goku fails to convince them otherwise, Beerus swiftly threatens Krillin into staying, while Bulma agrees to pay out the promised reward. In Universe 6, Cabba takes Caulifla to a deserted wasteland to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan. As Caulifla's protégée, Kale (ケール, Kēru), observes them, Cabba ineffectually attempts to provoke Caulifla in order to make her transform. When that fails, he teaches her to focus her energy on an area in her back. Caulifla successfully transforms into a Super Saiyan. Caulifla tests her newfound power and agrees to join Universe 6's team for the Tournament of Power. She beckons Kale over to attempt the transformation herself. In Universe 11, Kahseral arrives at the Pride Trooper headquarters, where he and Toppo agree to leave the universe in their trainees' hands so they can participate in the tournament.

The Universe 7 team are unaware that a spy from Universe 4 is observing them. In Universe 6, Cabba and Caulifla attempt to teach Kale how to turn into a Super Saiyan but to no avail. Kale begins to despair over her own uselessness, and it enrages her enough to trigger her transformation into an extremely powerful Berserker Super Saiyan. Kale immediately goes berserk and attacks Cabba. Caulifla quickly deduces that Kale is jealous of her and Cabba's perceived relationship. She denies having any sort of feelings for Cabba. Kale calms down and collapses in Caulifla's arms. Cabba, who is impressed by Kale's power, decides to add her to Universe 6's team. Back in Universe 7, Goku arrives in the afterlife and receives King Yemma's permission to visit Frieza. He explains about the Tournament of Power and asks Frieza to join them. Frieza agrees to aid him on the condition that he be properly resurrected with Earth's Dragon Balls. When Goku hesitates to agree, Frieza goads him by playing to his desire to see how powerful Frieza can become. Goku accepts his terms. In Universe 4, Ganos (ガノス, Ganosu) reports Universe 7's latest actions to Universe 4's God of Destruction Quitela (キテラ, Kitera) and Supreme Kai Kuru (クル).

As Master Roshi completes his training at Korin's tower, Krillin and No. 18 head to No. 17's island to pick him up and drop off Goten, Trunks, and Marron. Goku goes to Fortuneteller Baba's home, where she completes the ritual to resurrect Frieza. As Goku and Frieza prepare to depart, an army of assassins arrives to claim their heads. Despite the time pressure, Frieza wounds the assassins' leader, transforms into his Golden form, and prepares for battle.

Frieza explains to Goku that he spent his recent incarceration in Hell undergoing intense mental training to overcome the stamina issues that plagued him during his previous battles with the Z-Fighters. He quickly slaughters most of the assassins, which horrifies Goku. The assassins' leader, who has been directly empowered by Sidra, attacks Frieza with Sidra's power, but Frieza manages to overcome and hijack the attack. Frieza spitefully uses the attack on Goku and traps him. Frieza tortures and kills the assassins until they reveal that Roh and Sidra hired them. Frieza contacts Universe 9 and offers his services as a defector. Roh and Sidra begin arguing about whether or not to accept him. Roh fears Frieza's psychopathic and treasonous nature, while Sidra wants his power. Sidra is confident he could kill him if he stepped out of line. Their argument buys time for Beerus and Whis to arrive and rescue Goku. Frieza cuts the connection. He begins making plans to use the Tournament of Power to manipulate the gods to suit his own ends. Goku and Frieza have a brief sparring match, which ends in a draw. Goku, Frieza, Beerus, and Whis return to the Capsule Corporation. The Universe 7 team prepare to travel to the World of Void for the Tournament of Power.

In the World of Void, Universes 1, 5, and 8's Gods of Destruction Iwne (イワン, Iwan), Arack (アラク, Araku), and Liquiir (リキュール, Rikīru) have a brief exhibition match to test the durability of the Tournament of Power's fighting stage. Afterwards, the Grand Minister forces them all to clean up their mess and fix the stage. In Universe 7, Gohan and Shin's strategy is to have the team members stick together to conserve energy and use strength of numbers to defeat anyone who attacks them. This suggestion offends Goku and Vegeta's Saiyan pride. Whis transports the team to the World of Void. All of the other universes arrive. Frieza and Frost befriend each other and agree to work together, while Goku singles out Jiren as a potential rival due to his extreme power. As the Grand Minister introduces each team, Universe 4 seemingly has only 8 warriors on their team, which confuses most of Universe 7, except for Tien, who tells No. 18 that he can sense a faint presence. After a speech from the Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō, the 80 warriors prepare for battle.

The Grand Minister reminds everyone of the rules and officially starts the tournament. A massive free-for-all ensues. Goku targets Toppo, but he is intercepted by Ganos. Disregarding Gohan's plan as well, No. 17, No. 18, Vegeta, and Frieza all jump into the fray. Universe 3 gains an early advantage when Narirama unleashes a spinning attack designed to knock its opponents off the stage, but Hit and Basil disable it. Universe 10's Lilibeu (リリベウ, Ririberu) attacks Basil, but Basil successfully knocks her off the stage. Meanwhile, the five Universe 7 warriors who stayed together are confronted by a gang of warriors from varying universes, but Universe 7 uses teamwork to fend them off. Basil nearly defeats Universe 10's Napapa, but Napapa is able to push his attacks away at the last moment. As Goku is pursuing Toppo, he comes face to face with Jiren until Universe 4's Nink (ニンク, Ninku) outflanks Goku by grappling and dragging him towards the edge of the stage with the intention of jumping off with him. Goku turns Super Saiyan Blue and knocks Nink off the stage. As Goku reverts back to his normal form to conserve energy, Basil, Lavender, Bergamo, and two other Universe 9 warriors surround him with 47 minutes remaining in the tournament.

He fights Team Universe 9, where the Trio de Dangers brothers manage to overwhelm him thanks to their teamwork. Vegeta notices Goku's plight and reinforces him. Roh sends over three more fighters. Team Universe 9 is able to push Goku and Vegeta to the brink until Vegeta tricks Lavender and Hop (ソレル, Hoppu) into accidentally hitting each other. Goku and Vegeta take advantage of the confusion to defeat five of the Universe 9 warriors. No. 18 and Frieza each defeat Sorrel (ソレル, Soreru) and Roselle. Only Basil, Lavender, and Bergamo remain in the tournament for Team Universe 9. Goku and Vegeta push them to the edge of the stage. The brothers use a combination beam as a last ditch effort, but Goku and Vegeta power up to Super Saiyan Blue and knock them off the stage with a Final Kamehameha. With all 10 members defeated, Universe 9 is eliminated from the tournament. As a result, Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erase Universe 9, Roh, Sidra, and all of their fighters.

Krillin rescues No. 18, and the two defeat Shosa with a powerful combination attack. They are challenged by Universe 4's Majora (マジョラ), who is a blind fighter that uses his powerful sense of smell to locate his enemies in battle. Although Majora proves to be stronger than Krillin, Krillin disables his nose by throwing his smelly shoe at him and knocks him off the stage. Krillin boasts about his victory, which allows Frost to knock him off with a single blow. Beerus and Shin berate Krillin for his carelessness with 43 minutes remaining in the tournament.

They knock her unconscious and attempt to throw her off the stage, but Caulifla rescues her and defeats Napapa. The two confront Goku, and Caulifla knocks away Universe 2's Jimeze (ジーミズ, Jimizu) and demands to know how to become a Super Saiyan Blue. Goku refuses, and Caulifla transforms into an Ultra Super Saiyan. However, her increased muscle mass cripples her speed and allows Goku to counterattack. With Goku's aid, Caulifla manages to become a Super Saiyan 2, and the two resume their fight. As Kale watches them, she is once again consumed by her feelings of uselessness and transforms into her Berserker Super Saiyan form. Hit uses his time skip to save Caulifla from getting caught in the crossfire. Kale flies into a jealous rage and attacks Goku for allegedly stealing Caulifla from her. Kale easily overwhelms Goku and forces him to power up to Super Saiyan Blue. He unleashes a powerful Kamehameha, but Kale powers through it unharmed. As Piccolo realizes she has lost control of her power, Kale begins firing ki blasts at everything in sight and defeats Methiop. When Universe 11's Vuon (ブーオン, Būon) attempts to stop her, Kale defeats him as well. Jiren knocks her unconscious with a single ki blast. As Hit and Caulifla retreat with Kale, Goku challenges Jiren.

As Goku prepares to fight Jiren, Toppo suddenly ambushes him with a barrage of ki blasts. Toppo and Jiren decide to retreat and conserve their stamina. This leaves Goku to be dealt with by Kahseral and their fellow Pride Troopers Tupper (タッパー, Tappā), Zoiray (ゾイレー, Zoirē), Cocotte (ココット, Kokotto), and Kettol. The five declare their intent to defeat Caulifla and Kale to avenge Vuon's defeat. The two are forced to form a temporary alliance with Goku. Meanwhile, Master Roshi and Tien team up to defeat Universe 3's The Preecho (ザ・プリーチョ). They regroup with Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Frieza, where he has defeated Murichim. The Pride Troopers push Goku, Caulifla, and Kale to the brink, but No. 17 and No. 18 rescue them. No. 18 and Goku defeat Tupper, while No. 17 easily overpowers Kahseral. The remaining Pride Troopers regroup and focus their assault on the wounded Caulifla and Kale. Cocotte seals them in a separate dimension to ensure that Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 do not interfere. As the four beat Caulifla, Kale's self-hatred causes her to return to the Berserker Super Saiyan form, but she remains in control of herself this time. Caulifla and Kale use an extremely powerful combination ki blast to defeat Kahseral, Zoiray, and Kettol. Cocotte seals herself in a mini-dimension to avoid the blast, but No. 18 simply throws it off, eliminating Cocotte. Goku allows Caulifla and Kale to retreat so he can fight them at their full strength after they rest. The group is unaware that Brianne is observing them.

No. 17 blasts them before they can transform, but Brianne, Goku, and Toppo berate him for his dishonorable tactics and browbeat him into allowing them to transform, much to Beerus' dismay. They assume their alter-egos Ribrianne, Kakunsa (カクンサ, Kakunsa), and Rozie (ロージィ, Rōjī) and barrage the arena with a powerful love-based attack that brainwashes some of the fighters. Universe 7's mental discipline allows them to overcome its effects. Gohan's group elects to split up and fight independently. Vegeta attacks Ribrianne, who counters with a rolling attack that knocks out Universe 10's Jirasen (ジラセン). Rozie attacks Goku with a flurry of blows that grows more powerful the longer she keeps it up, while Kakunsa battles No. 17 with her animalistic fighting style. No. 17 baits her into overextending herself and stuns her with a barrier. He attempts to knock her out of the stage, but her teammate Vikal (ビカル, Bikaru) rescues her.

Elsewhere, Botamo challenges Gohan on Champa's orders. As Piccolo and Goku observe, Gohan attacks with a flurry of blows, which apparently have no effect. However, Gohan's attacks begin to lift Botamo off the ground and renders him unable to defend himself, allowing Gohan to knock him off the stage. Universe 10's Obuni (オブニ) and Rubalt (ルバルト, Rubaruto) appear to challenge Gohan and Piccolo. Jimeze defeats Universe 10's Jilcol (ジルコル Jirukoru). With 8 warriors eliminated, Gowasu accepts his imminent demise, while Rumsshi remains defiant. Obuni shifts his ki away from his body to render himself impossible to detect and wounds Gohan. Rubalt initially has the upper hand against Piccolo, but Piccolo uses his Hellzone Grenade attack to knock out Rubalt, leaving Universe 10 with only Obuni. Obuni begins to overwhelm Gohan, which makes Gowasu want to cling to life again. Gohan powers up and powers through one of Obuni's punches. He counterattacks Obuni's moves by locating and hitting Obuni after he gets hit. Obuni pauses the fight to show his respect for Gohan, but refuses to lose for the sake of Universe 10. Gohan battles and defeats Obuni with a Kamehameha. All of Universe 10's fighters have been eliminated.

Dyspo challenges Hit and uses his incredible speed to overwhelm Hit's Time Skip. Everyone quickly deduces that Dyspo is listening for the sound of Hit's body tensing up to determine when he is about to attempt to use Time Skip. Hit resorts to fighting him conventionally, but he is pushed to the edge of the stage. Toppo deduces that Hit has adjusted to Dyspo's fighting style and is luring him into a trap. Toppo sends fellow pride trooper Kunshi (クンシー, Kunshī) to back him up. Before Dyspo can land the finishing blow, Hit suddenly turns intangible and sends Dyspo over the edge. However, Kunshi uses ropes made of his energy to pull Dyspo back onto the stage before he is eliminated. The two launch a renewed assault against Hit and drive him into a corner. Before they can finish him off, Goku interferes and rescues Hit. Goku uses his Super Saiyan God form to counter Dyspo's speed, while Hit uses his assassination technique to injure Kunshi. The two switch places. Hit uses a fake Time Skip to throw Dyspo off and wound him, while Goku overwhelms Kunshi with his Super Saiyan Blue form. Hit attempts to eliminate Dyspo, but Kunshi rescues him again. Kunshi charges Hit, who turns intangible and knocks him off the stage. Dyspo retreats and regroups with his allies. Toppo abandons all notions of justice and decides to focus on survival. Hit decides not to battle Goku as thanks for lending a hand.

Master Roshi quietly observes the battles from afar. He is challenged by an attractive warrior from Universe 4, Caway (キャウェイ, Kyauei), who attempts to seduce him. However, Caway's attempts to attack him brings him back to his senses. Roshi destroys her energy weapon, powers up, and drives her to jump off the stage. Roshi is next challenged by Dercori (ダーコリ, Dākori), who is a talisman-wielding warrior from Universe 4. She uses her talismans to confound Roshi with illusions and trap him in a single spot. Roshi uses the Evil Containment Wave to seal her in a small bottle and throw her off the arena. Quitela and Beerus get into an argument about the legality of the move, which is defused when Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō rule in Roshi's favor. Ganos, who is enraged at Roshi for eliminating his friends, challenges him and powers up into an avian form. Initially, Roshi is able to use his experience to predict, evade, and counter Ganos' attacks. However, Ganos is able to grow more powerful the longer a fight drags on. He rallies and delivers a fierce series of blows to Roshi. Roshi attempts to hypnotize Ganos into falling asleep, but he attacks himself to wake himself up. Ganos demands that Roshi accept his limits and give up, but Roshi refuses. He unleashes a Max Power Kamehameha that defeats Ganos. However, the effort is too much for Roshi's body to handle, and he collapses. Goku races over to him and successfully defibrillates him with his ki. Goku escorts Roshi to safety.

Goku brings Master Roshi to an isolated part of the stage and leaves him to rest at his request. Gohan and Piccolo are confronted by Universe 6's Dr. Rota (Dr.ロタ, Dokutā Rota), but Rota is shot down by a sniper before he can reveal his ability. Gohan and Piccolo are unable to find the location of the sniper until they find a red orb on the ground. It is revealed that the sniper, Universe 2's Prum (プラン, Puran), can see through these orbs. The lasers ricochet off of the orbs so that his true location is a secret. Piccolo tries to create a smokescreen in order to blur the vision, but Prum can still see them via their heat signatures. Prum shoots Piccolo and destroys both of his arms, which forces him to painfully regenerate them. Gohan and Piccolo realize that the orbs depend on heat signatures and blast the surrounding area to create multiple heat signatures. Prum responds by coming out of his hiding spot and blasting the entire area. Gohan and Piccolo are forced into hiding. Tien analyzes Dr. Rota and deduces that he was hit by a sniper as Goku and Vegeta arrive. Vegeta berates Tien, who warns them about Prum, but Vegeta arrogantly brushes it off until he is almost incapacitated by one of Prum's blasts. As Goku and Tien observe Prum, they deduce that there is another shooter from behind as Prum is merely reflecting the blasts. Vegeta and Goku go after Prum, while Tien goes to save Gohan and Piccolo. Goku and Vegeta try to attack Prum, but their ki blasts are reflected off of his body. Tien navigates through the field of blasts and confronts the true sniper, Prum's teammate Hermila (ハーミラ, Hāmira). Realizing that Prum can deflect ki blasts and not physical attacks, Vegeta and Goku throw giant boulders at him. Tien uses his Multi-form technique in order to buy himself time against Hermila, but three of his clones are shot down. The fourth and final Tien defeats Hermila. Just as Tien is about to eliminate him, Hermila shoots the ground underneath Tien's feet and knocks him off the stage. However, Tien's other three clones come back and drag Hermila down with them. Tien and Hermila are eliminated from the tournament. Although Beerus praises Tien for forcing the battle into a draw, Tien is noticeably upset about being defeated. As Prum is confronted by Vegeta, Dr. Rota comes back and attacks Prum as revenge for shooting him. Shortly after, Vegeta eliminates Prum and Dr. Rota from the tournament.

Magetta arrives to reinforce Frost, and the two battle Vegeta. Frost goads Roshi into using the Evil Containment Wave on Magetta despite the risk of killing himself. When Roshi falls for it, Frost reflects the attack and seals Vegeta into a bottle. With the last of his strength, Roshi uses a small ki blast to destroy the bottle and free Vegeta. Vegeta immediately turns Super Saiyan Blue, and Frost flees. Vegeta knocks Magetta off the stage and tells Roshi to drop out so he can receive medical attention.

Jimeze makes use of his Instant Transmission technique to confound and damage Gohan. As he prepares to finish him, Frieza intervenes. When Frieza does not immediately attack Jimeze, Universe 7's spectators speculate he may intend to betray and defeat Gohan so he can seize the wish on the Super Dragon Balls for himself. Frieza steps aside and allows Jimeze to continue his fight with Gohan. Jimeze corners Gohan again and attempts to finish him, but Frieza destroys his attack with a ki blast. Enraged, Jimeze attacks Frieza, who swiftly tortures and eliminates him. Frost appears and declares his intention to defeat Gohan, and Frieza admits that the two intend to work together in order to exact revenge on the Saiyans. Frieza battles Gohan, who counterattacks. Frieza uses his Golden form to knock out Gohan. However, instead of eliminating him, he double-crosses and eliminates Frost.

Ribrianne declares her intention to use the wish to become a love goddess adored by all beings using the Super Dragon Balls. Goku considers using the wish to benefit his family or meet a strong opponent. Ribrianne absorbs the love of her teammates and becomes Super Ribrianne. She attacks Goku with several ki blasts, and he counters by turning Super Saiyan Blue and knocking her away. Ribrianne lands near Jiren, and Goku sees him and prepares to finally battle him. Universe 11's God of Destruction, Belmod, telepathically orders Jiren to defeat Goku. Belmod hopes to demoralize the other universes by defeating the strongest fighter besides Jiren himself. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20, but that proves to be no match for Jiren's overwhelming power. Goku begins powering up a Spirit Bomb, and all of his teammates except Vegeta lend him their energy. Despite the time it takes to charge the attack, Jiren agrees to wait for him to complete it. Ribrianne attempts to attack Goku from behind, but she is stopped by Vegeta. Goku completes the Spirit Bomb and throws it, but Jiren deflects it. The two engage in a struggle to take control of the Spirit Bomb. This forces Goku to use Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20 to keep up.

Goku powers up himself and pushes the Spirit Bomb back towards Jiren, which locks him in a stalemate. Whis realizes that Jiren is at least as powerful as a God of Destruction. As the two struggle to overpower each other, the Spirit Bomb suddenly condenses into a small black hole, which absorbs Goku and causes him to vanish. The Grand Minister rules that since Goku's own attack apparently vaporized him, Jiren will not be disqualified for destroying him. As Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō prepare to eliminate Goku, he suddenly reappears and reaches a new level of power. Goku resumes the fight, and he is able to go toe-to-toe with Jiren. Whis theorizes Goku must have absorbed the Spirit Bomb and unlocked an ability called Ultra Instinct (身勝手の極意”兆”, Migatte no Gokui). Goku uses another powerful attack in an attempt to eliminate Jiren, but he fails, and exhausts his newfound power. Jiren knocks him away, and Hit attempts to take advantage of the opportunity and attacks Jiren. Vegeta demands to know what happened to Goku before preparing to fight Ribrianne, while Frieza appears to corner Goku and aims an attack at him.

Instead of killing the defenseless Goku, Frieza shares with him some of his energy and repays his act of mercy during their fight on Planet Namek. Meanwhile, Hit uses his time-skip powers against Jiren, but his attacks fail to connect. Goku spectates the battle, but he is ambushed by Saonel (サオネル, Saoneru) and Pirina (ピリナ, Pirina), Namekians from Universe 6, who are confronted by Gohan and Piccolo. Elsewhere, Vegeta fights Ribrianne, and he is easily overpowering her in his base form until Rozie interferes and retreats with Ribrianne. Ribrianne loses hope due to the gap in power, but Rozie motivates her. Meanwhile, Hit keeps attacking Jiren to no avail, but he is able to react and block most of Jiren's punches. After being knocked back, Hit sneaks up behind Jiren and lands a strong punch on his heart. He knocks Jiren to the edge of the ring after a brief struggle. Hit uses his own time-skip powers continually on Jiren to stop his movement. Realizing that he cannot hold Jiren for long, Hit urges Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale to keep fighting for Universe 6. Hit pools all his energy in a final attack to defeat him, but Jiren stops Hit's attack only with his glare. Jiren breaks free and eliminates Hit. As the Tournament of Power reaches its midway point, Jiren begins to meditate. He is certain that there are no other warriors strong enough to fight him. Jiren leaves the fight to Toppo and Dyspo. Viara (ビアラ, Biara) and Katopesla (カトペスラ, Katopesura) of Universe 3 attempt to attack him while meditating, but Jiren's energy alone is enough to push them back.

Caulifla demands that Goku fight her and teach her how to unlock Super Saiyan 3 so that she can become strong enough to win the tournament. She begins fighting Goku, who does not initially power up beyond his base form. However, Goku's superior martial arts skills allow him to keep up with her even in her Super Saiyan 2 form. Eventually, she is able to adapt to his moves, which forces Goku to power up to Super Saiyan 2 himself. The two of them fight evenly for some time. Goku later calls in Kale to join the battle. His superior power and skill enables him to fight them both at once, but they are able to match him by working together. They land a massive combined attack on him, but Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 3 and easily deflects their attacks. However, Goku lacks the stamina to maintain that form and reverts to Super Saiyan 2. Kale's desire to become stronger inadvertently causes her to transform into her Berserker Super Saiyan form again.

Vegeta continues his battle with Toppo, while Caulifla is able to help Kale regain control of her Berserker form. Caulifla and Kale battle Goku together and are able to hold him off. Meanwhile, Frieza is confronted by Katopesla, but they are interrupted by Goku's battle with Caulifla and Kale. Frieza wants to fight Caulifla and Kale, but Goku insists that he will fight them himself. Frieza backs down and watches the fight. The three Saiyans resume their battle. After unsuccessfully attempting to use Instant Transmission as a strategy, Goku powers up to his Super Saiyan God form and easily overpowers the two of them. As Goku prepares to eliminate Caulifla and Kale with a powerful Kamehameha, it is revealed that the girls were given a pair of Potara earrings by Fuwa, Universe 6's Supreme Kai. They use the earrings and fuse to become a single being with immense power, who takes the name Kefla (ケフラ, Kefura).

As Vegeta continues to fight Toppo, Gohan and Piccolo are engaged with Saonel and Pirina. No. 18 is attacked by Katopesla, but she is saved by No. 17. Meanwhile, Goku continues his fight with Kefla. The Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō approve Kefla's use of the Potara earrings. The other universes consider giving the Potara to their warriors as well. Pell (ペル, Peru), the Supreme Kai of Universe 2, gives his Potara to Rabanra (ラバンラ, Rabanra) and Zarbuto (ザーブト, Zābuto), but the earrings are destroyed by Kefla charging through them to continue fighting Goku. The battle becomes intense with Kefla gaining the upper hand. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue, but Kefla counters by powering up to Super Saiyan. However, Goku uses the Kaioken and regains the advantage. He appears to be winning, but Kefla lands a sneak attack that knocks him out of Super Saiyan Blue. She prepares to eliminate him, but Goku unexpectedly reawakens Ultra Instinct again and easily dodges her attacks.

To counter Goku's increase in power, Kefla powers up to Super Saiyan 2, and the two of them face off. Goku still easily dodges Kefla's attacks, but his own attacks are not strong enough to take her down. Whis explains that when Goku launches his attacks, it interferes with his concentration and prevents him from using Ultra Instinct to its full potential. Jiren senses the energy from the battle, which prompts him to awaken from his meditation and rejoin Toppo and Dyspo. Vegeta realizes that Ultra Instinct is the level of skill that Whis was training him and Goku to attain, and decides that he must reach it too. Goku begins running low on stamina, so he declares that he will end the fight with his next attack. Kefla panics and unleashes a multitude of deadly energy beams. Her ultimate attack devastates the ring, but Goku easily dodges her blasts while charging a Kamehameha. Goku jumps into the air, so Kefla focuses all of her power into a single blast and launches it at him, taking advantage of his apparent inability to dodge. However, he backflips and uses the charged-up energy to slide over her attack, and launches his Kamehameha at point-blank range, blasting Kefla out of the ring and eliminating her. Her Potara earrings shatter, and she splits back into Kale and Caulifla. With both of them eliminated, Saonel and Pirina are the only remaining warriors from Team Universe 6.

Goku is left exhausted from his battle with Kefla. He is confronted by all five remaining warriors from Universe 2. Gohan and Piccolo try to help him, but they are intercepted by Saonel and Pirina. Elsewhere, Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and tries to unlock Ultra Instinct against him. However, he is unsuccessful, and resorts to his normal fighting style. Vegeta easily overpowers Katopesla. Rozie and Ribrianne launch a combined attack at Goku, but No. 17 and No. 18 arrive in time to deflect it. The androids battle Rozie and Ribrianne. No. 17 defeats and eliminates Rozie, while No. 18 knocks Ribrianne out of her powered-up transformation. This causes her to revert into Brianne. Brianne is able to catch No. 18 in an energy trap, while her comrades from Universe 2 send their love to her. This allows Brianne to transform into a giant manifestation of her Super Ribrianne form. No. 18 almost gives up until her love for Krillin and Marron gives her the determination to break free of Ribrianne's trap. With No. 17's help, No. 18 blasts through Ribrianne's giant form and eliminates her. Brianne realizes that she lost because of No. 18's strong love for Krillin, while Goku faces off against Zirloin (ザーロイン, Zāroin), Zarbuto, and Rabanra of Universe 2.

Saonel and Pirina's power suddenly increases, and it is revealed that they had each fused with many Namekians from their universe before coming to the tournament, which greatly increased their own powers. No. 17 and No. 18 join Goku to help in the battle against the remaining Universe 2 warriors. It is revealed that Universe 2's angel, Sour (サワア, Sawaa), has been broadcasting the tournament to the populace of their universe. Universe 2's inhabitants channel their love to Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, who are able to transform into forms similar to Ribrianne, Rozie, and Kakunsa's transformed states. Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 battle Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo continue fighting Saonel and Pirina. The Universe 2 trio unleash a legendary Universe 2 technique, the Pretty Black Hole, which traps and threatens to sink Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 through the fighting stage. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue and breaks through the Pretty Black Hole with a Kamehameha that eliminates Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo blast Saonel and Pirina off the ring with a powerful combined attack that eliminates them as well. With all of their fighters eliminated, both Universe 2 and Universe 6 are erased. Brianne leads the Universe 2 team in a final happy moment before their erasure, while Cabba wishes Vegeta good luck. Champa taunts Beerus before being erased. Beerus remains impassive in the face of his brother's erasure. Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and warns him that he is in a bad mood.

Vegeta overpowers Katopesla and drives him to the edge of the ring. Katopesla is able to catch himself, but he is pushed over the edge and eliminated by an unseen force. Vegeta and Gohan are attacked by the same force, but Vegeta is able to stop himself from going over the edge, while Piccolo catches Gohan. No. 18 is attacked by the invisible fighter, who is revealed to be one of the missing Universe 4 fighters, Gamisaras (ガミサラス, Gamisarasu). Gohan creates a cloud of dust that coats Gamisaras, which allows Piccolo to see him. Piccolo easily eliminates Gamisaras. Undaunted, Quitela orders the remaining Universe 4 fighters to step up their game. Shantza (シャンツァ, Shantsa) generates a dome that envelops the Universe 7 team and manifests illusions of the defeated fighters from the erased universes. However, Piccolo spots Shantza and blasts him off the ring, which eliminates him and destroys the illusions. Universe 4's last fighter, Damon (ダモン, Damon), is also assumed to be invisible since no one can see him. Piccolo is able to sense Damon's attacks, but he proves unable to hit Damon, who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him. No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug-like creature rather than an invisible person, which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him. To solve this problem, Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air, which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts. No. 17 traps Damon in a miniature force field and kicks him out of the ring to eliminate him. With all of their fighters eliminated, Universe 4 is promptly erased.

While Viara is defeated and eliminated by No. 17 and No. 18's combined efforts, Paparoni (パパロニ, Paparoni) sends Panchia, Koitsukai, and Bollarator to attack Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta. To help Goku and Vegeta save their energy to confront Universe 11, Gohan decides to face the three robots alone. He gains the upper hand until Paparoni has them combine together into a much stronger robot called Koichiarator (コイチアレータ, Koichiarēta). Koichiarator overpowers Gohan until Goku and Vegeta step in. The two distract the enemy, while Gohan charges and strikes with an attack powerful enough to defeat it. With his robots defeated, Paparoni refuses to surrender and declares that he will unleash his trump card on Universe 7.

Paparoni and Koichiarator merge to form Anilaza (アニラーザ, Anirāza), the most powerful warrior from Universe 3. Anilaza begins to overwhelm the Saiyans, which forces No. 17 and No. 18 to reinforce them. The five attempt to coordinate their attacks to catch Anilaza off-guard, but he deflects them all. It is revealed that Anilaza can use echolocation to detect his opponents' movements. Anilaza begins teleporting his punches, and he nearly knocks Goku off the stage until Frieza steps in and knocks him back onto the fighting stage. Realizing that the Universe 7 warriors will rescue each other from defeat, Anilaza attempts to eat No. 18, who is rescued by Goku. Anilaza corners No. 17 and overwhelms him. He knocks him off the fighting stage, but No. 18 sacrifices herself to kick No. 17 back onto the fighting stage. She is eliminated from the tournament. With no other options, the Universe 7 warriors power up to their maximum levels and engage in a ki clash with Anilaza. They buy time for No. 17 to pierce through Anilaza's attack and damage his energy reactor. This enables the others to overwhelm and eliminate Anilaza. With all of their warriors eliminated, Universe 3 is erased. As the Universe 7 warriors begin to celebrate, the remaining Universe 11 warriors step forward to challenge them.

With only two universes remaining, the Grand Minister compresses the bleachers so that the remaining spectators are all close together. The final warriors begin their battle: Gohan and No. 17 battle Toppo, Frieza fights Dyspo, and Goku and Vegeta battle Jiren. Jiren overwhelms Goku with a flurry of punches, but Vegeta is able to analyze Jiren's attack patterns and dodges his attacks. He lands a solid blow to Jiren's midsection, but Jiren counters with a powerful blast that nearly rings Vegeta out. Meanwhile, Frieza blocks one of Dyspo's attacks with his tail, but Dyspo uses it as leverage to injure him. Jiren disparages Vegeta for his self-righteousness, but Vegeta declares that it is the source of his strength. He powers up a Final Flash and goads Jiren into taking it head-on. However, the attack fails to damage Jiren, who acknowledges the power of Vegeta's attack before incapacitating him.

With Vegeta down, Goku faces off against Jiren. Meanwhile, the other battles continue. Frieza decides to start fighting Dyspo seriously, while Gohan and No. 17 are outmatched against Toppo. Outmatched in power, Goku instead uses ki blasts to create a minefield around Jiren, but it has no effect. Goku then lures Jiren onto a large rock that extends out over the edge of the fighting stage and cuts through the rock with a Destructo Disc. This causes Jiren to fall, but Jiren is able to push off the falling debris and jumps back onto the fighting stage. Angered by his near-elimination, Jiren finally shows his real power and easily overwhelms Goku with a volley of punches. Goku and Vegeta both get back up and power up to Super Saiyan Blue. Goku uses his maximum Kaioken beyond his previous limitations, while Vegeta is able to surpass his limits by tapping into more ki in his body, and attains a transformation similar to the Ascended Super Saiyan form, the Super Saiyan Blue Evolution form. Fully powered up, Goku and Vegeta attack Jiren as a team, and they are able to catch him off guard with their un-coordinated attacks.

As Goku and Vegeta continue their battle with Jiren, the battle between Dyspo and Frieza intensifies. The two seem evenly matched, until Frieza breaks off the fight and offers to help Universe 11 win the tournament if they promise to resurrect him with the Super Dragon Balls. Dyspo refuses the offer, so Frieza powers up to his Golden form and gains the advantage in the fight. Dyspo reveals his own ultimate technique, the Super Maximum Light Speed Mode, which increases his power and speed even further, and overwhelms Frieza. Gohan and No. 17 realize that Frieza is in danger of being knocked off the fighting stage, so No. 17 distracts Toppo, while Gohan goes to Frieza's aid. Gohan and Frieza take on Dyspo as a team, but they have little success. Gohan develops a strategy that has Frieza use his energy to form a cage around Dyspo, which prevents him from using his high-speed attacks and allows Gohan to gain the upper hand. Unfortunately, Frieza runs out of energy, and the cage dissolves before Gohan can land the finishing blow. However, Gohan is able to grab Dyspo and hold him in place, while Frieza launches a blast that knocks them off the fighting stage and eliminates them both from the tournament.

Goku and Vegeta continue their battle with Jiren, while No. 17 and Toppo fight. No. 17 and Toppo engage in a beam clash, which Toppo is winning. Frieza intervenes and strikes Toppo repeatedly from behind, which allows No. 17 to overpower Toppo's blast. In the wake of the explosion, Toppo appears to have been defeated. However, he gets back up and powers up, using the same type of energy as a God of Destruction. Belmod explains that Toppo is a candidate to be Universe 11's next God of Destruction, which is why he can wield the same kind of power. Toppo unleashes his new power, which damages the fighting stage and breaks a large portion of it. No. 17 and Frieza attack Toppo repeatedly, but his power is now far superior to theirs. Toppo easily defeats them both. Fortunately, they are able to stay on the fighting stage, but Toppo knocks Frieza unconscious and engages in another beam clash with No. 17.

Toppo easily overpowers No. 17's blast. No. 17 is able to evade him for a while by using the broken fighting stage to his advantage, but Toppo effortlessly withstands No. 17's attacks. Toppo prepares to eliminate No. 17 with a giant energy blast. Frieza rejoins the battle and deflects Toppo's attack. Frieza uses his own energy attack to immobilize Toppo, which allows him and No. 17 to land numerous attacks, but none of them have any effect. Toppo is about to eliminate them both, when he is interrupted by Goku and Vegeta, who are still fighting Jiren. Frieza and No. 17 are hit by one of Jiren's attacks, which gives Toppo the opportunity to attack Vegeta instead. Toppo overwhelms Vegeta with his new power and states that he has cast aside everything else in order to become strong enough to win the tournament. However, Vegeta is inspired by his family, his promise to Cabba, and his Saiyan pride. He refuses to cast anything aside. Vegeta unleashes his full power and overwhelms Toppo. Vegeta and Toppo both use their ultimate attacks: Toppo unleashes his Energy of Destruction, while Vegeta uses the Final Explosion technique that he used against Majin Buu. Vegeta's attack overwhelms Toppo's attack, blasts Toppo out of the fighting stage, and eliminates him from the tournament. This also causes even more damage to the fighting stage. Due to Vegeta being much stronger than the last time he used the Final Explosion technique, he survives the blast, but his energy is almost completely drained. No. 17 also reappears, but he has been injured by Jiren's attack. Goku, Vegeta, and No. 17 all face off against Jiren, who begins to unleash his full power.

Jiren powers up to his maximum. Goku, Vegeta, and No. 17 all attack him simultaneously, but he easily overpowers them. However, No. 17 manages to land a sneak attack and injures Jiren. Jiren defeats Goku and Vegeta, while Frieza rejoins the fight and tries to kill Jiren in his golden form. However, Frieza is easily defeated as well. No. 17 asks Jiren what his wish on the Super Dragon Balls would be, and Belmod explains that Jiren's endless pursuit of strength was inspired when his parents, most of his comrades, and mentor were killed by a powerful villain. However, his abandonment by his surviving friends turned Jiren into a loner who distrusted friendship, and he now focuses solely on increasing his own strength. No. 17 admires Jiren's human qualities, but he accuses Jiren of using the rest of his universe's team for his own ends. Jiren rebuffs him and fires a powerful energy blast down at No. 17, Goku, and Vegeta. No. 17 uses a barrier to hold back Jiren's blast and forms force fields around Goku and Vegeta to protect them, before self-destructing to destroy Jiren's blast. Despite his exhausted state, Vegeta faces off against Jiren and declares that he will defeat him.

Vegeta prepares for a final stand against Jiren. Although Vegeta is too exhausted to turn into even a Super Saiyan, he still decides to take on Jiren. Jiren easily dodges his attacks and continues to pummel Vegeta. Jiren injures Vegeta's left eye in the process. Vegeta is knocked to the brink of elimination, and he begins to think about the people in his life he cares about the most. He gets back up and continues to fight Jiren, who is impressed by Vegeta's pride. Vegeta nearly rings out again. His boot catches onto a floating piece of rubble, which narrowly allows him to stay in the fight because the pieces of rubble still count as part of the fighting stage. Vegeta hears Bulma's voice urging him to fight on, and he returns to fight Jiren once again. Jiren is unable to understand why Vegeta continues to fight him. Vegeta fires off a Final Flash, but Jiren is unfazed. Jiren knocks Vegeta out of the fighting stage and eliminates him from the tournament. Although Vegeta is upset at being unable to last until the end, he gives Goku his remaining energy at the last second before falling out of bounds. Goku turns Super Saiyan Blue and begins to fight Jiren with his remaining power. Even with Vegeta's energy, Goku is still overwhelmed by Jiren. He is knocked back into his base form. When Goku is pushed back to the edge of the fighting stage and only one punch away from defeat, Vegeta shouts at Goku. Goku thinks about how the others have all put their faith in him. As Jiren delivers the final blow, Goku suddenly reactivates Ultra Instinct and dodges the attack. With his new power, Goku is able to effortlessly dodge Jiren's attacks and lands a heavy blow on him. Both fighters face off and prepare for their final battle.

Whis points out that, since Goku has no allies to help him and no time to recover from the strain caused by Ultra Instinct, this will be his last chance to end the battle. Goku and Jiren resume their battle, but Goku has the same problem he experienced with Kefla, and is unable to attack at his full potential. Goku tries the same trick he used on Kefla by powering up a Kamehameha and firing it at Jiren, but Jiren is able to punch through the blast. Belmod is confident that Goku's incomplete Ultra Instinct will not be enough to win, but Vegeta points out that, throughout the tournament, all of the Saiyans have been able to surpass their limits and achieve higher levels of power. Jiren is able to trap Goku on a single floating rock and fires a barrage of attacks down at him in an attempt to knock him out, but Goku begins blocking Jiren's attacks with his own punches. Jiren launches a final blast down at Goku, but Goku suddenly powers up immensely. He easily blocks Jiren's blast and jumps back up to the fighting stage. Jiren attacks again, but this time Goku easily overpowers him with a flurry of punches. Whis reveals that Goku has completed his ascension. Goku's hair and eyes have turned silver, and he now has full mastery over Ultra Instinct.

Despite almost being defeated twice, Goku stands up and recovers. When Jiren asks why Goku refuses to surrender, his friends claim that the source of Goku's strength comes from the trust between him and his companions. Refusing to accept it, an enraged Jiren launches an attack on the bleachers that is repelled by a furious Goku, who finally defeats him. However, just as Goku is about to knock Jiren out, his body collapses from the strain of using Ultra Instinct for too long. Jiren takes the opportunity to knock Goku off the fighting stage, but Goku is saved by Frieza. No. 17 is also revealed to have survived Jiren's blast. As Frieza and No. 17 prepare themselves to face Jiren, Goku writhes in pain.

With Goku down, Frieza and No. 17 face off against Jiren. No. 17 manages to injure Jiren, who collapses from exhaustion. Frieza is about to eliminate Jiren, who accepts his impending defeat, but Toppo calls out to Jiren and inspires him to keep fighting despite his injuries. Jiren powers up and fires a massive blast at Frieza and No. 17. They form a barrier to shield themselves, but Frieza is running low on energy and loses his Golden form. Before Jiren can overpower them, Goku manages to get back up and rejoins the others. Goku adds his strength to the barrier and enables them to block Jiren's blast. Goku and Frieza take on Jiren together, while No. 17 provides cover fire. Working together, Goku and Frieza overpower Jiren and tackle him out of the ring. All three of them are eliminated from the tournament. With all of their fighters gone, Universe 11 is erased. As the only fighter remaining on the fighting stage, No. 17 is declared the winner of the Tournament of Power, and he is given the privilege of getting his wish granted from the Super Dragon Balls. After some consideration, No. 17 wishes to restore all of the universes that had been erased, which brings all their inhabitants back to life. As the erased universes are restored, the Grand Minister reveals that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had foresaw the outcome of a virtuous being winning the Tournament of Power who would make a selfless wish on the Super Dragon Balls. He also stated that they would have otherwise erased the entire multiverse if the winner had wished for selfish reasons, as this would have shown that the winning universe was no better than the erased universes and that the universes excluded from the tournament were not equally worthy of existing. As a reward for doing well in the tournament, Whis restores Frieza to life. In Universe 11, Jiren establishes a real friendship with Toppo and looks forward to having a rematch with Goku someday. The group from Universe 7 return home. Frieza leaves Earth and resumes leadership of his empire. Goku vows to defeat him if he starts causing trouble again. Goku and Vegeta meet for a sparring match in the place where they first fought. Goku reveals that he cannot use Ultra Instinct anymore and believes that he obtained it by accident during the tournament. Goku and Vegeta declare that they will keep finding new levels of strength. They race towards each other to fight.

Scrooge takes an interest in Cratchit's desperately-ill son, Tiny Tim, and asks the Ghost if Tim will live.

If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population."" The spirit then warns Scrooge to ""forebear that wicked tongue until you have discovered for yourself what the surplus is, and where it is."" and chillingly tells him ""It may be, that in the sight of heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than MILLIONS like this poor man's child.""",NONE,a little warmth,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1787, Virginia had roughly ten times the population of Rhode Island, whereas today California has roughly 70 times the population of Wyoming, based on the 1790 and 2000 censuses.

2870,Kudzu in the United States,when was kudzu introduced to the united states,"The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.[6][7][13] Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition. The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches,[6][14] and in the first half of the 20th century, kudzu was distributed as a high-protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion. It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl.[15] The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government-aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government-funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare.[6] By 1946, it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares (3,000,000 acres) of kudzu had been planted.[6] When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms, kudzu plantings were left unattended.[6] The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked. In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970. By 1997, the vine was placed on the ""Federal Noxious Weed List"".[4][6] Today, kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares (7,400,000 acres) of land in the southeastern United States, mostly in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Mississippi.[6][10] It has been recorded in Nova Scotia, Canada, in Columbus, Ohio, and in all five boroughs of New York City.[10]",NONE,1876,,,,,,,,,,,,

The culmination of the Yorktown campaign, the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American theater, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict. The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war, as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain.[8]",NONE,American Continental Army troops led by General George Washington and French Army troops led by the Comte de Rochambeau,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unable to work things out, they broke up.
After the sudden death of her father, Kitty discovered, along with the rest of the Walker family, that her father had been cheating on her mother and had embezzled money from the company pension fund, putting the family business at risk. Feeling betrayed and vulnerable, Kitty slept with cohost Warren Salter, further complicating things with Jonathan, who wanted to reconcile with her. Soon after, they ultimately decided it was for the best if they broke up permanently. Jonathan returned to New York. Kitty was therefore free to pursue an affair with Warren but he was hesitant, as he was already involved with his young assistant, Amber. Warren finally asked Kitty out, and she accepted on the condition that he set things straight with Amber. When Kitty discovered that he didn't do so, she realized they didn't have a future together.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2898,Uncle Sam,where does the saying uncle sam come from,"The precise origin of the Uncle Sam character is unclear, but a popular legend is that the name ""Uncle Sam"" was derived from Samuel Wilson, a meatpacker from Troy, New York who supplied rations for American soldiers during the War of 1812. There was a requirement at the time for contractors to stamp their name and where the rations came from onto the food they were sending. Wilson's packages were labeled ""E.A â€“ US."" When someone asked what that stood for, a co-worker jokingly said, ""Elbert Anderson [the contractor] and Uncle Sam,"" referring to Wilson, though the ""US"" actually stood for United States.[10] Doubts have been raised as to the authenticity of this story, as the claim did not appear in print until 1842.[11] Additionally, the earliest known mention definitely referring to the metaphorical Uncle Sam is from 1810, predating Wilson's contract with the government.[9] As early as 1835, Brother Jonathan made a reference to Uncle Sam, implying that they symbolized different things: Brother Jonathan was the country itself, while Uncle Sam was the government and its power.[12]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plasmodesmata evolved independently in several lineages,[3] and species that have these structures include members of the Charophyceae, Charales, Coleochaetales and Phaeophyceae (which are all algae), as well as all embryophytes, better known as land plants.[4] Unlike animal cells, almost every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall. Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls and the intervening middle lamella, forming an extracellular domain known as the apoplast. Although cell walls are permeable to small soluble proteins and other solutes, plasmodesmata enable direct, regulated, symplastic transport of substances between cells. There are two forms of plasmodesmata: primary plasmodesmata, which are formed during cell division, and secondary plasmodesmata, which can form between mature cells.[5]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A sugya, including baraita or tosefta, will typically comprise a detailed proof-based elaboration of a Mishnaic statement, whether halakhic or aggadic. A sugya may, and often does, range widely off the subject of the mishnah. The sugya is not punctuated in the conventional sense used in the English language, but by using specific expressions that help to divide the sugya into components, usually including a statement, a question on the statement, an answer, a proof for the answer or a refutation of the answer with its own proof.[citation needed]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

March 4 – The BBC Television Service broadcasts one of the first television plays specially written for the medium, Condemned To Be Shot by R. E. J. Brooke, live from its London studios at Alexandra Palace. The production is notable for the use of a camera as the first-person perspective of the play's unseen main character.
March 27 – The BBC broadcasts the entirety of Magyar Melody live from His Majesty's Theatre in London. The 175-minute broadcast is the first showing of a full-length musical by television.
April

Television demonstrations are held at the 1939 New York World's Fair on Long Island and the Golden Gate International Exhibition in San Francisco.
RCA, General Electric, Dumont and others begin selling television sets to the public in the New York City area. Screen sizes typically range from 5 to 12 inches, and Dumont features 14-inch and 16-inch models. Prices start at $200 and go as high as $1000.


April 30 – Franklin D. Roosevelt, appearing at the opening ceremony of the 1939 New York World's Fair, becomes the first President of the United States to give a speech that is broadcast by television.
May 17 – The first baseball game (Princeton University vs. Columbia University) is broadcast by television, from Baker Field in New York. Bill Stern is the announcer.
May 19 – The Walt Disney cartoon Donald's Cousin Gus airs on NBC's experimental station W2XBS (later WNBC-TV) in New York. This marks the first movie cartoon to be televised in the United States.
June 1 – The first heavyweight boxing match is televised, Max Baer vs Lou Nova, from Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.

Poland broadcasts a feature film for the first time—Barbara Radziwiłłówna (1936)—using the experimental transmitter mounted atop the Prudential building in Warsaw.


August 31 – 18,999 television sets have been sold in England before manufacture stops due to World War II.
September 1 – The anticipated outbreak of World War II brings television broadcasting at the BBC in Britain to an end at 12:35 p.m. after the broadcast of a Mickey Mouse cartoon, Mickey's Gala Premier, various sound and vision test signals, and announcements by presenter Fay Cavendish. It is feared that the VHF waves of television would act as a homing signal for guiding enemy bombers to central London: in any case, the engineers of the television service would be needed for the war effort, particularly for development of radar. The BBC would resume its broadcasting, with the same Mickey Mouse cartoon, after the war in 1946.
September 30 – The first televised college football game, Fordham University vs Waynesburg College, at Randall's Island, New York.

When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning (""Something to Sing About""). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her that the only way to go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his marriage plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been (""What You Feel—Reprise"") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs (""Where Do We Go from Here?""). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss (""Coda"").",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2970,Gestalt psychology,today gestalt psychology ideas are part of which branch of psychology,"Gestalt psychology or gestaltism (German: Gestalt [ɡəˈʃtalt] ""shape, form"") is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology. Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self-organizing tendencies. The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking.[1][2] The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception.[2] In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception, the authors concluded that ""even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists, there is little theoretical coherence. What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology? Perhaps there is, in fact, little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together.""[3]",NONE,Berlin School of experimental psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,

2973,Long John Silver,how did long john silver lose his leg in treasure island,"Long John Silver is a cunning and opportunistic pirate who was quartermaster under the notorious Captain Flint. Long John Silver had a pet parrot called Captain Flint, often seen sitting on his shoulder where she would nibble on seeds. Silver claims to have served in the Royal Navy and lost his leg under ""the immortal Hawke"". ""His left leg was cut off close by the hip, and under the left shoulder, he carried a crutch, which he managed with wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a hamâ€”plain and pale, but intelligent and smiling."" (Treasure Island (1883) by Robert Louis Stevenson page 82). He claims to have been the only man whom Flint ever feared. Like many of Stevenson's characters, there is more than a modicum of duality in the character; ostensibly Silver is a hardworking and likeable seaman, and it is only as the plot unfolds that his villainous nature is gradually revealed. His relationship with Jim Hawkins, the novel's protagonist and narrator, is interesting, as he serves as a mentor and eventually father-figure to Jim, creating much shock and emotion when it is discovered that he is in charge of the mutiny, and especially when Jim must confront and fight him later on. Although willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests, Silver has compensating virtues: he is wise enough to pay attention to money management, in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates, and is physically courageous despite his disability; for instance, when Flint's cache is found to be empty, he coolly stands his ground against five active seamen despite having only Jim, a boy in his teens, to back him.

The first United States locations were opened in Deerfield Beach, Florida and Pompano Beach, Florida in 1981, but they proved unsuccessful and were closed.[85] In 1985, the chain returned to the US with a location on Niagara Falls Boulevard in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst, New York.[86] Starting in the mid-1990s, however, the chain began expanding in the US by acquiring former locations from fast food chains. In 1996 and 1997, thirty-seven former Rax Restaurants locations in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia were bought by Wendy's International Inc.; 30 of these were converted to Tim Hortons, while the others became Wendy's franchise locations. Thirty-five closed Hardee's stores in the Detroit area were also purchased with the intention of being converted.[87] By 2004, the chain had also acquired 42 Bess Eaton coffee and doughnut restaurants situated in southern New England. Several combination Wendy's/Tim Hortons units were opened in the US; both in the ""traditional"" markets of Maine and Buffalo, where there were well over 180 locations as of 2011,[88] and in the markets entered through acquisition.",NONE,1981,,,,,,,,,,,,

3000,Wah-Wah (song),what is george harrison song wah wah about,"""Wah-Wah"" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass. Harrison wrote the song following his temporary departure from the Beatles in January 1969, during the troubled Get Back sessions that resulted in their Let It Be album and film. The lyrics reflect his frustration with the atmosphere in the group at that time â€“ namely, Paul McCartney's over-assertiveness and criticism of his guitar playing, John Lennon's lack of engagement with the project and dismissal of Harrison as a songwriter, and Yoko Ono's constant involvement in the band's activities. Music critics and biographers recognise the song as Harrison's statement of personal and artistic freedom from the Beatles. Its creation contrasted sharply with his rewarding collaborations outside the group in the months before the Get Back project, particularly with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York.",NONE,his frustration with the atmosphere in the group at that time,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory in 1572 and colonization of the region as the Viceroyalty of Peru. The conquest of the Inca Empire (called ""Tahuantinsuyu""[1] or ""Tawantinsuyu""[2] in Quechua, meaning ""Realm of the Four Parts""),[3] led to spin-off campaigns into present-day Chile and Colombia, as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin.",NONE,conquistador Francisco Pizarro,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia. Additionally one other species of camel [3] in the separate genus Camelops, C. hesternus [4] lived in western North America and became extinct when humans entered the continent at the end of the Pleistocene.

Struggling from a lack of customers, Mr. Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia) decides to close the store, but Audrey suggests he may have more success by displaying an unusual plant that Seymour owns.

3045,Liberal arts education,where did the term liberal arts come from,"Rooted in the basic curriculum – the enkuklios paideia or ""education in a circle"" – of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece, the ""liberal arts"" or ""liberal pursuits"" (Latin liberalia studia) were already so called in formal education during the Roman Empire. The first recorded use of the term ""liberal arts"" (artes liberales) occurs in De Inventione by Marcus Tullius Cicero, but it is unclear if he created the term.[5][6] Seneca the Younger discusses liberal arts in education from a critical Stoic point of view in Moral Epistle 88.[7] The exact classification of the liberal arts varied however in Roman times,[8] and it was only after Martianus Capella in the 5th century AD influentially brought the seven liberal arts as bridesmaids to the Marriage of Mercury and Philology,[9] that they took on canonical form.",NONE,the Roman Empire,,,,,,,,,,,,

3048,Jury trial,who is entitled to a trial by jury,"Every person accused of a crime punishable by incarceration for more than six months has a constitutionally protected right to a trial by jury, which arises in federal court from Article Three of the United States Constitution, which states in part, ""The Trial of all Crimes...shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed."" The right was expanded with the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states in part, ""In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed."" Both provisions were made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Most states' constitutions also grant the right of trial by jury in lesser criminal matters, though most have abrogated that right in offenses punishable by fine only. The Supreme Court has ruled that if imprisonment is for six months or less, trial by jury is not required, meaning a state may choose whether or not to permit trial by jury in such cases.[61] Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, if the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, he may waive his right to have a jury, but both the government (prosecution) and court must consent to the waiver. Several states require jury trials for all crimes, ""petty"" or not.[62]",NONE,Every person accused of a crime punishable by incarceration for more than six months,,,,,,,,,,,,

3053,List of American Horror Story: Freak Show characters,american horror story freak show girl kidnapped by clown,"
Twisty the Clown (portrayed by John Carroll Lynch) originally was a slow-witted but gentle clown at a freak show in 1943. Jealous of his popularity, the freaks of the carnival spread rumors that he was a child molester and drove him away. With nowhere else to go, he returned home to Jupiter, Florida, only to find that his mother had died. After failing to support himself by selling toys made of junk to a local toy store, Twisty attempted suicide by putting a shotgun in his mouth. However, the attempt failed – he succeeded only in mutilating his lower jaw – and he later began to wear a grinning mask over the lower part of his face. Twisty then tried to perform as a clown at Elsa's freak show, but was turned away. Twisty then snapped and went on a killing spree, abducting children to be his audience, while murdering their ""mean"" parents. He kidnaps Corey Bachman and murders his parents, after kidnapping Bonnie Lipton to serve as his audience's babysitter. Gloria hires Twisty to entertain Dandy, who becomes his accomplice. Twisty and Dandy hold a magic show on Halloween, before Jimmy knocks Dandy unconscious and Maggie gets Corey and Bonnie to safety. Twisty then knocks Jimmy out before encountering Edward Mordrake, who was attracted by the noise of the clown's performance. Twisty tells Mordrake his story, and Mordrake deems the clown suitable to be in his entourage of damned souls and kills him. When Elsa summons Mordrake in 1962, Twisty appears alongside the other freaks and comforts her in her last moments. According to director Ryan Murphy, Lynch was so terrifying as this character that ""half the time, almost a third of the crew left the set when they shot his scenes because they were afraid of him."" In Cult, a comic book detailing a fictionalized version of Twisty is owned by Oz Mayfair-Richards.
Bonnie Lipton (portrayed by Skyler Samuels) is a young girl who is kidnapped by Twisty, after Twisty murders her boyfriend Troy. She attacks Twisty and attempts to escape with Corey, but is dragged back to him by Dandy. She escapes Twisty with the help of Jimmy and Maggie in ""Edward Mordrake (Part 2)"".
Regina Ross (portrayed by Gabourey Sidibe as older Regina, Nya Auzenne as young Regina) is a student at secretary school hoping to get a position at a law firm after graduation, who returns home to Jupiter when her mother Dora goes MIA. In ""Pink Cupcakes"", she calls Gloria concerning her mother and why she hasn't been returning her calls. The conversation turns strange and Regina feels uncomfortable and hangs up, wary of what happened. She turns up at the Mott Manor in ""Blood Bath"", very suspicious of where her mother is. She threatens to call the police if she doesn't see her mother soon. In ""Tupperware Party Massacre"", Dandy admits to the murder of Dora and lets Regina escape unharmed, despite her refusal to take a blood bath with him. Upon returning with police detective Jack Colquitt, Dandy admits to the murders and boasts about his family's wealth, buying off Colquitt for a million dollars. Regina is killed when Dandy orders Colquitt to shoot and bury her.
Dora Ross (portrayed by Patti LaBelle) is a local townswoman who begins to discover secrets about Dandy. She is the mother of Regina and the put-upon maid to Gloria Mott. In ""Massacres and Matinees"", she reveals to Gloria that she found dissected animal parts behind the shed, implying they belong to Dandy. She dislikes Dandy's spoiled attitude and didn't get scared of him when he tried to kill her. In ""Edward Mordrake (Part 2)"", she dies when Dandy slashes her throat and Gloria helps bury her in their backyard.
Paul (portrayed by Mat Fraser) also known as Paul The Illustrated Seal is a performer in the freak show, who was born with phocomelia of both arms. In ""Edward Mordrake (Part 2)"", he tells Mordrake that he immigrated to the United States from Britain to be in show business. However, he arrived during the Great Depression. In an act of despair, he tattooed his whole body except his face, because he believed that it would have been considered handsome and loveable if it wasn't on a freak. It is revealed that he is not only Elsa's secret lover, but that of Penny too, his true love. He confronts Elsa in ""Bullseye"" about the recent disappearance of Bette and Dot, and she in turn snaps at him for his relationship with Penny. She later becomes angry about a public confrontation with the rest of the troupe and demands one of them place themselves on the spinning wheel, to prove their trust of her. Paul volunteers and it is assumed she purposely threw the last knife into his gut, injuring him badly, leaving him bed ridden. He is then shocked and guilt-stricken later on in ""Test of Strength"" over Penny's mutilation. In ""Curtain Call"", after trying to stand up to Dandy, he is the first freak to be shot and killed during Dandy's massacre. He and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife, where he and Penny have gotten married.
Eve (portrayed by Erika Ervin) also known as Amazon Eve is a performer in the freak show. She is abnormally large. She is seen as the piano player of the show and is also instrumental with protecting the troupe, along with Jimmy and Paul. In ""Bullseye"", she becomes concerned over Ma Petite's disappearance until Maggie turns up with her, healthy and alive. Initially, Eve is somewhat quiet and even-tempered, but in ""Test of Strength"", Dell attempts to murder her in her caravan. Afraid that he is attempting to rape her, Eve defends herself by savagely beating him and throws him out. She goes to Ethel where she cares for her bruised hand. She and the other women of the freak show then plot to kill Dell once and for all. In ""Curtain Call"", she is the last freak to be killed by Dandy after she tries to overpower him in Desiree's caravan. She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife.
Mahadevi Patel (portrayed by Jyoti Amge) also known as Ma Petite, is a performer in the freak show, who also serves as Elsa's assistant. She is seen playing a miniature violin of sorts and also serves as Elsa's manicurist and ""cuddle"" toy in the later hours. She was born with achondroplasia which results in an extremely short stature, and is thus deemed the world's shortest woman. Seen as the baby of the troupe, Ma Petite's sweet nature and naive innocence leads her to trust almost everyone, with ultimately tragic consequences. Maggie lures her away one night attempts to murder her in ""Bullseye"" for Stanley, but can't force herself to go through with it. In ""Test of Strength"", Dell, under the pretense of gifting her with a new dress, hugs her and then squeezes until her spine snaps and she dies. He gives her body to Stanley and it is later seen being presented by Lillian in her Museum of Morbid Curiosities in a jar of formaldehyde, where her birth name is revealed. The carnies later find her bloody dress in an area full of unidentified bones, and believe that she has been eaten by a wild animal. She later appears to Dell in a hallucination before he attempts suicide by hanging. She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife, where Ma Petite once again helps Elsa to get ready for her performance.
Lillian Hemmings (portrayed by Celia Weston) is the curator of the Museum of Morbid Curiosities; she collects and buys strange artifacts for her museum. She catches Stanley and Maggie's fraudulence but says if she is offered something of real worth from a freak show, she will pay big money. Stanley regularly imagines scenarios with her presenting him with money and acclaim for his finds. In ""Test of Strength"", she unveils her new exhibit to various wealthy people of Ma Petite's dead body (presented as Mahadevi Patel, the world's smallest woman), floating in a jar of what is assumed to be formaldehyde. In ""Orphans"", she is seen revealing Jimmy's claw hands. In ""Show Stoppers"", it is revealed that she was murdered by Desiree shortly after Maggie's fainting spell; her decapitated and preserved head is given to Stanley before the freaks attack and mutilate him.
Penny (portrayed by Grace Gummer) is a candy striper at the local hospital. In the first episode, she is drugged and kidnapped by Elsa and taken back with her to the freak show. She is blackmailed by Elsa into staying at the camp because Elsa filmed her in a drug-fueled orgy with the freaks. It is later revealed she is in a relationship with Paul, but her father begins to abuse her over the affair. In ""Test of Strength"", she attempts to move out but before she can do so, her father Vince hires a man to mutilate her face – tattooing her with scales, giving her a forked tongue, and shaving half her hair off while she is unconscious. She is accepted by the freak show and takes the name The Astounding Lizard Girl. In ""Blood Bath"", she and the women of the freak show kidnap her father and feather and tar him for what he did, but she spares his life after being persuaded by Maggie. In ""Curtain Call"", she is shot and killed during Dandy's massacre. She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife, where she and Paul have gotten married.

3064,Lōʻihi Seamount,what is loihi and where does it originate from,"Lōihi Seamount (also known as Lōʻihi) is an active submarine volcano about 35 km (22 mi) off the southeast coast of the island of Hawaii.[6] The top of the seamount is about 975 m (3,000 ft) below sea level. This seamount is on the flank of Mauna Loa, the largest shield volcano on Earth. Lōihi, meaning ""long"" in Hawaiian, is the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, a string of volcanoes that stretches over 5,800 km (3,600 mi) northwest of Lōʻihi. Unlike most active volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean that make up the active plate margins on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Lōʻihi and the other volcanoes of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain are hotspot volcanoes and formed well away from the nearest plate boundary. Volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands arise from the Hawaii hotspot, and as the youngest volcano in the chain, Lōihi is the only Hawaiian volcano in the deep submarine preshield stage of development.",NONE,an active submarine volcano about 35 km (22 mi) off the southeast coast of the island of Hawaii,,,,,,,,,,,,

3072,The Windmills of Your Mind,who sings the original windmills of your mind,"In the original 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair, the song is heard – sung by Noel Harrison – during opening credits; and, during the film, in a scene in which the character Thomas Crown flies a glider at the glider airport in Salem, New Hampshire: having edited the rough cut for this scene utilizing the Beatles track ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" producer/director Norman Jewison commissioned an original song be written for the glider scene which would reference the ambivalent feelings of Thomas Crown as he engages in a favorite pastime while experiencing the tension of preparing to commit a major robbery. Alan Bergman: ""Michel [Legrand] played us [ie. Alan and Marilyn Bergman] seven or eight melodies. We listened to all of them and decided to wait until the next day to choose one. We three decided on the same one, a long baroque melody... The lyric we wrote was stream-of-consciousness. We felt that the song had to be a mind trip of some kind"" – ""The [eventual] title was [originally] a line at the end of a section... When we finished we said: ""What do we call this? It's got to have a title. That line is kind of interesting.' So we restructured the song so that the line appeared again at the end. It came out of the body of the song. I think we were thinking, you know when you try to fall asleep at night and you can't turn your brain off and thoughts and memories tumble.""[2]",NONE,Noel Harrison,,,,,,,,,,,,

12.94[11]


On the Big Three's 37th birthday, Randall wants to adopt a baby, but Beth convinces him they can honor William's legacy by adopting an older child. Kate auditions as a band's lead singer after initially leaving, because all the other women auditioning are thin. She is rejected because of her inexperience, not her weight; Kate is confident she can work her way up. Toby tells Kevin that he, not Kevin, needs to be Kate's ""person."" Kevin explains that Kate informed him of their father's death, and being Kate's brother is the only thing he is really good at. In the past, Rebecca takes the Big Three to a movie after her argument with Jack. Rebecca urges Jack to come home; Jack admits his drinking is out of control. Later, the family house has burned and Rebecca, in the car with Jack's possessions in a bag, screams and cries.

11.06[12]


Kevin is invited back for the 100th ""The Manny"" episode. The producers try to embarrass him for how he left the show, but Sophie helps him do it anyway. Randall, Beth, their girls, Rebecca, and Miguel travel across the country to see the live episode. Randall and Beth take a walk during the taping to discuss Randall's worries about fostering an older child who could have major issues. Also during the taping, Kate gets a call for her first gig; however, she does not want her mother to criticize her performance, so Kate asks both Rebecca and Toby not to follow her, but they do anyway. Later, Kate confronts Rebecca about how she has always treated her. Rebecca seeks support from Toby, but he clearly sides with Kate, which wins Rebecca's approval. After the episode taping, Beth learns from Kevin that Randall only risked failure once: in asking her out. Beth reassures Randall they can go through with their plan. In flashbacks, Jack confesses to teenage Kate that he has an alcoholism problem. Jack (when on the wagon before) vented his anger on a punching bag; this time, he lets Rebecca take him to an AA meeting.

11.02[13]


On Kevin's movie set, Kate—excited that Sylvester Stallone is his co-star—bonds with ""Sly"" and tells him what his films meant to her father, and about his death. After talking with Stallone, Kevin's memories of his dad surface, affecting his performance in a scene. Randall learns that a young girl, Deja, is being brought to his home. Later, when Deja yells at Beth for ""stealing"" her mom's cigarettes, Randall defends his wife, and Deja shrinks to defend herself from apparent aggression. Randall talks to Deja about the joy he found in having Jack and Rebecca, as well as William. Kevin takes pain medication after injuring his knee—his old football injury—from a scene explosion during filming. In flashbacks, when the kids are teenagers, Jack talks about his efforts to rehabilitate from alcoholism; Randall tries to find his birth parents through an ad, and is comforted by Kate and Kevin after a woman claims to be his birth mother for his family's money.

Randall takes his daughters and Deja bowling, which does not go as expected. Beth offers to help Deja take care of her hair, and the two bond. Randall admits to Deja that he has had problems with nervous breakdowns and has taken up running to deal with his anxiety; he invites her to come with him. Kevin undergoes surgery on his injured knee, and continues to overuse his pain medication. Kate visits a gynaecologist for an ultrasound, revealing that she is pregnant. In flashbacks, Kate and Kevin contract the chicken pox, and their doctor urges Randall to do his best to catch them as well so it would not occur later for him. Rebecca's mother pops in intent on staying for a while, and her overbearing attitude and the fact that she treats Randall differently than Kate and Kevin leads to Rebecca confronting her about it all and calling her a racist, which Randall overhears. Rebecca's mother takes her words to heart and reaches out to Randall, recognizing for the first time how special he is.

Kate and Toby share news of her pregnancy. Kevin, set to be auctioned off by Sophie for a large-scale charity event she is hosting, gets drunk while trying to get a pain medication prescription; he misses the auction, embarrassing Sophie. Randall earns Deja's trust. In the past, when Jack takes 10-year-old Kevin and Randall camping, Rebecca learns that Jack's father is dying. She calls Jack, but he had issues with his father, and he is trying to have Kevin get along with Randall, so Jack says that he will not return. Rebecca reassures Jack's father (who sees his granddaughter, Kate) that Jack is a great father and husband. Kevin finds a notebook where Randall wrote notes of how to keep peace between them, motivating him to be nice to Randall. Later, Jack looks at a picture of him and his brother in the army. During Jack's childhood, he and his never-before-seen brother await their father's return to the car as he gets drunk at a bar.

In flashbacks, with the 10-year-old Big Three, Rebecca takes Randall trick-or-treating, while Jack takes Kate and Kevin to a haunted house. Randall learns about Kyle's death from the neighbors; Rebecca then tells him the facts of his adoption. In other flashbacks, with the Big Three being in their twenties, Kate finds out she is involved with a married man. Kevin, desperate for work as an actor, attempts to steal a role from his roommate and best friend. Meanwhile, Randall and Beth prepare for the arrival of their first daughter. Beth unexpectedly goes into labor after agreeing to help Rebecca get a Facebook account. With no time to get to the hospital, Randall helps Beth through a home delivery. Kate and Kevin commiserate about their deadbeat lives and decide to live together. When Rebecca posts a photo of her granddaughter on Facebook, she gets a message from Miguel, asking how she has been the last 8 years. (Jack's death was sometime before Miguel last saw Rebecca.)

After Rebecca's letter about being Randall's mother, the judge recuses himself; the new judge grants the adoption. Concurrently, William pleads guilty to a drug charge. Although the judge is disappointed because William had a clean record, William claims to be more disappointed, due to the loss of his loved ones and son. The judge visits William in jail, offering to reduce the sentence and get him help, if he stays sober. William keeps this promise for at least 30 years, until hearing his cancer is terminal. As he is about to use, Randall introduces himself as William's biological son. In the present, Randall takes Deja to visit her mother Shauna in prison, but Shauna declines the visit. Randall later talks to Shauna, who intends to take Deja back after her release. He lets Shauna call Deja collect.

Toby finds junk-food trash. Randall and Beth check on Tess; she said she was sad when Deja went home. The family visits Kevin at rehab; Barbara, the facilitator, wants only immediate family at Kevin's first session. Kevin apologizes to the family, but Barbara has him discuss family issues. Kevin says they are a family of addicts. Kevin felt like an outcast (""fifth wheel""): Kate had Jack's support; Rebecca loved Randall more than Kevin. Randall scolds Kevin; Rebecca, crying, says why Randall was easier to love. Toby, Beth, and Miguel talk at a bar about being outsiders, Miguel being the only one who knew Jack. After the session, the Big Three reconcile; Rebecca tells Kevin why she never worried about him, but they had their moments. Kate admits to Toby about hiding junk food since miscarrying. When the kids are 10, Jack takes the family to a cabin vacation, getting Kevin after football camp. Randall's new glasses are missing. Rebecca notices Kate's food obsession; Jack has her exercise, but later takes her for ice cream. During a thunderstorm, Kevin brings Randall's glasses to their parents' room—Kate and Randall are sleeping with them. He sleeps on the floor; Rebecca joins him.

William’s stray cat “Clooney” wanders. After rehab, Kevin stays with Rebecca—whom Miguel is protecting since Kevin upset her by getting arrested and criticizing her at rehab. Miguel later tells Kevin that Jack and Rebecca were a unified couple, not separate individuals; thus, he did not love Rebecca while Jack was alive, but does now and is staying. Kate befriends Madison from support group; they go wedding dress shopping, where Kate discovers Madison’s bulimia; Madison later faints and calls Kate for help. Kate says losing weight as a teenager did not make her happy. Randall visits Beth at work; she says working again would help him. Randall gets William’s box from storage, searches for a lady about whom William wrote and drew, and discovers from a picture it was Billie Holiday. Randall tells Beth he wants to buy and manage the run-down building with her. When the kids are teenagers, Jack and Rebecca take them shopping for suits and dresses for the winter formal and Jack's job. Though the kids are almost starting college, Jack again wants to start ""Big Three Homes"" (which he put aside to support his family). Randall asks a redhead out. Someone forgets smoke detector batteries.

An elderly couple, circa 1980, looks through their junk, including a jukebox which would play ""That'll Be the Day"". When the house gets a buyer, the man gives his neighbor, Jack, a crockpot. Present-day Randall and Beth buy William’s old building. Kevin helps Randall do repairs; they soon find themselves overwhelmed—and bugs, so the building is vacated when an exterminator is called. Since Toby looks online for a dog, Kate—with mixed feelings—adopts a dog. Kevin tries to make amends to Sophie (who says goodbye), receives his missing pendant in the mail—and knows he cannot make amends to his dad. In flashbacks, Jack and Rebecca watch the Super Bowl alone as the teenagers are otherwise occupied—Kevin is with Sophie, Randall is on a date—Kate is making an audition tape (which Jack videotapes, to Kate’s initial disapproval) for the music college. The old crockpot's faulty switch causes the house fire.

The word rate refers to an enlisted sailor's pay grade, while the word rating refers to one's area of occupational specialization within the enlisted Navy.

This enlisted numbering system is the same across all five branches of the U.S. military. All E-1 through E-3 are known as Seamen. E-4 through E-6 are called petty officers. All E-7s are called chief petty officer, E-8s senior chief petty officer, and E-9s master chief petty officer.[1] Rates are displayed on a rating badge, which is a combination of rate and rating.

On the surface of it, it appears that it is all about the Casuarina tree, but actually the tree is just a medium to link the poetâ€™s past with the present. The poet remembers the tree because of the many happy memories of childhood days that are linked to it which are a source of comfort and consolation to her in another country. The poem, therefore, underlines the importance of memories in human life. The tree brings to her mind the memories of time when she used to play under it in the company of her brother and sister, both of whom are already dead. She was very close to her dead brother and sister named Abju and Aru respectively who loved the Casuarina tree very greatly. So she loves the tree greatly. But lost in the memories of her siblings who are now dead, she is looking forward to death as an acceptable thing. The memories of her brother and sister brings tears into her eyes. She hopes that the tree will be remembered for ever as the yew trees of Borrowdale immortalized by Wordsworth are still remembered. She immortalizes the tree for the sake of her loved ones by writing a poem for it.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3259,Redistricting,who is responsible for redrawing congressional and legislative districts,"In 28 states, the state legislature has primary responsibility for creating a redistricting plan, in many cases subject to approval by the state governor. To reduce the role that legislative politics might play, twelve states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington) determine congressional redistricting by an independent or bipartisan redistricting commission.[1] Five states: Maine, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia give independent bodies authority to propose redistricting plans, but preserve the role of legislatures to approve them. Arkansas has a commission composed of its governor, attorney general, and secretary of state. Seven states have only a single representative for the entire state because of their low populations; these are Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the HCl is secreted by active transport into the stomach. The enzyme hydrogen potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) is unique to the parietal cells and transports the H+ against a concentration gradient of about 3 million to 1, which is the steepest ion gradient formed in the human body.

3279,Blood alcohol content,blood alcohol concentration means the parts of alcohol in the blood in relation to what,"There are several different units in use around the world for defining blood alcohol concentration. Each is defined as either a mass of alcohol per volume of blood or a mass of alcohol per mass of blood (never a volume per volume). 1 milliliter of blood has a mass of approximately 1.06 grams. Because of this, units by volume are similar but not identical to units by mass. In the U.S. the concentration unit 1% w/v (percent mass/volume, equivalent to 10 g/l or 1 g per 100 ml) is in use. This is not to be confused with the amount of alcohol measured on the breath, as with a breathalyzer. The amount of alcohol measured on the breath is generally accepted as proportional to the amount of alcohol present in the blood at a rate of 1:2100. Therefore, a breathalyzer measurement of 0.10 mg/L of breath alcohol converts to 0.0001×2100 g/10dL, or 0.021 g/dL of blood alcohol (the units of the BAC in the United States). While a variety of units (or sometimes lack thereof) is used throughout the world, many countries use the g/L unit, which does not create confusion as percentages do. Usual units are highlighted in the table below.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3283,Battle of Bunker Hill,who said don't shoot until you see,"The famous order ""Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes"" was popularized in stories about the battle of Bunker Hill. It is uncertain as to who said it there, since various histories, including eyewitness accounts,[101] attribute it to Putnam, Stark, Prescott, or Gridley, and it may have been said first by one, and repeated by the others.[102] It was also not an original statement. The idea dates originally to the general-king Gustavus Adolphus (1594â€“1632) who gave standing orders to his musketeers: ""never to give fire, till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy's eye"".[103] Gustavus Adolphus's military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated. It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham, when his troops defeated Montcalm's army on September 13, 1759.[104] The earliest similar quote came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27, 1743, where Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw warned his Regiment, the Royal Scots Fusiliers, not to fire until they could ""see the white of their e'en.""[105] The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745, and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great, and may have been mentioned in histories the colonial military leaders were familiar with.[106] Whether or not it was actually said in this battle, it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect, especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited.[107]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the warm tropical summer weather, some incongruences such as decorations with themes of winter and snow are not uncommon. In some cities like Guarapuava, there are decoration contests, when judges go to houses to look at the decorations, inside or outside of the house, and decide the most beautiful house. Christmas Eve is the most important day.

The title was however informal and used alongside the equally informal principal ministre d'Ã‰tat (""chief minister of the state"") more as a job description. After 1661, Louis XIV and his descendants refused to allow one of their ministers to be more important than the others, so the term was not in use.[3]",NONE,1624,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Dean explains what Jack is to a local officer, Jack explains he learned English from his mother and grew up quickly because she told him the world was dangerous; she also said that Castiel was the father who would protect him. Three angels show up wanting to use Jack's almost limitless power for themselves. The Winchesters banish two of them and kill the third; Jack is stabbed in the heart in the process but is unharmed by the blade. Dean agrees to take him to the bunker, but only until they can find a way to kill him. They are on their own with Chuck not answering prayers. They give Castiel and Kelly a hunter's funeral, also saying goodbye to Crowley and Mary whom they assume Lucifer killed. In the alternate world, Lucifer keeps Mary alive because he needs her for something.

On the way back to the bunker, the Winchesters and Jack stop at a hotel and are met by Donatello the prophet. Amara ate his soul, but he has been mentally making the moral choice ever since, and he was drawn to Jack's power. Jack reads the Bible to learn more about himself and his family. Realizing he'll need more protection, the Winchesters try to get him warding tattoos, but he reflexively attacks the tattoo artist for hurting him and his body heals the ink away. Dean takes this as proof that Jack will turn evil, while Sam thinks it's because he lacks control. Meanwhile, the final Prince of Hell, Asmodeus, takes charge of Hell until Lucifer returns, disguising himself as Donatello to trick Jack into freeing the Shedim — Hell's darkest creatures — to be a hero. The brothers and the real Donatello appear, and when Asmodeus hurts them, a flicker of Jack's power makes him flee. At the bunker, Dean admits to Jack that he will kill him if he turns bad. In the alternate world, Lucifer protects Mary, intending to trade her for Jack when they get home. They meet an alternate version of Michael, who killed his world's Lucifer. Michael is the stronger of the two, and keeps this Lucifer alive because he needs him for something.

She warns them and Dean kills the wraith. James and Dean think Patience should live a normal life, but Jody says it is Patience's choice and that her door is open if she needs help. Meanwhile, Sam tries to train Jack because he reminds him of his own days addicted to demon blood. Jack makes no progress, which he takes as a sign he will be evil, since his powers only work negatively.

3325,List of Full House and Fuller House characters,who played the middle sister on full house,"Stephanie Judith Tanner (portrayed by Jodie Sweetin) is the witty, sarcastic middle child of Danny and Pam, the younger sister of D.J., and the older sister of Michelle. Her mother died when she was five years old. Her catchphrases during the early seasons of the series include ""how rude!,"" ""well, pin a rose on your nose!"" and ""hot dog"". She eventually evolved into something of a tomboy in seasons four and five. Stephanie has a habit of spying on D.J.'s life by reading her diary and eavesdropping on her telephone calls (having been caught in the act several times), and is generally the most athletic and nosiest of the Tanner girls.

3349,Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF,where does trick or treat for unicef money go,"In 1953, the United States Committee for UNICEF, now called the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, started actively promoting the program.[7] By the 1960s, the concept had expanded throughout the United States, with small orange collection boxes distributed to millions of trick-or-treaters.[9] When UNICEF won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson said in his congratulatory letter: ""Your UNICEF Trick or Treat Day has helped turn a holiday too often marred by youthful vandalism into a program of basic training in world citizenship.""[10] In 1967, Johnson declared Halloween, October 31, to be 'UNICEF Day' in the United States; by 1969, 3.5 million American children were trick-or-treating for donations.[9] Children (and adults) in the U.S. have collected more than US $175 million for Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF.[5][11] Donations to Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF support UNICEF's global programing, but in 2005, half of the proceeds were targeted to a domestic cause, aiding victims of Hurricane Katrina.[12] In 2008, the U.S. Fund for UNICEF introduced mobile phone text message donations as well as a MySpace and Facebook page.[13] In 2014, the U.S. Fund for UNICEF partnered with Crowdrise to expand the campaign's online presence, allowing participants to create personal fundraising web pages in addition to traditional door-to-door trick-or-treating.[14]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the reasons that bribery is regarded as a notorious evil is that it contributes to a culture of political corruption in which the public trust is eroded.

They joined 28 Australian ships and the Australian light cruisers HMAS Sydney and Melbourne at Albany, Western Australia. The Japanese also sent the cruiser Chikuma to patrol the Indian Ocean during the convoy′s crossing to Aden. During the crossing, HMAS Sydney was caught up in the Battle of Cocos (9 November), but the Japanese-escorted convoy reached Aden on 25 November.

3479,Tower of London,who built the tower of london in 1066,"The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins),[3] although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.",NONE,William the Conqueror,,,,,,,,,,,,
3480,Land lot,what's the size of a plot of land,"Lots can come in various sizes and shapes. To be considered a single lot, the land described as the ""lot"" must be contiguous. Two separate parcels are considered two lots, not one. Often a lot is sized for a single house or other building. Many lots are rectangular in shape, although other shapes are possible as long as the boundaries are well-defined. Methods of determining or documenting the boundaries of lots include metes and bounds, quadrant method, and use of a plat diagram. Use of the metes and bounds method may be compared to drawing a polygon. Metes are points which are like the vertices (corners) of a polygon. Bounds are line segments between two adjacent metes. Bounds are usually straight lines, but can be curved as long as they are clearly defined.",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment. Although debates have not been highly publicized, a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age,[4] while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010.[5]",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Billboard placed them at the top of their ""Year In Rock"" rankings for 2013[2] and 2017[3] and named them their ""Breakthrough Band of 2013"". and ""Biggest Band of 2017.""[4] Rolling Stone named their single ""Radioactive"", which holds the record for most weeks on the Hot 100, from Night Visions the ""biggest rock hit of the year"",[1][5][6] and MTV called them ""the year's biggest breakout band"".[7] The band's second studio album Smoke + Mirrors (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK.[8][9] After a brief hiatus, the band released their third studio album, Evolve (2017) which resulted in the chart-topping singles, ""Believer"" and ""Thunder"".

This phase was formerly called the resting phase. However, interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting; rather, the cell is living, and preparing for later cell division, so the name was changed.

Competitors perform a series of tricks while going down the pipe. The current world record for highest jump in a half-pipe is held by Joffrey Pollet-Villard, with 26 feet 3 inches (8.00 metres).[1] The sport is considered to be dangerous compared to other sports, and helmets are required to be worn during competitions. Half-pipe skiing has been part of the Winter X Games since 2002, and made its Olympic debut at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. David Wise of the United States of America became the first Olympic champion in this discipline with a total of 92.00 points.[2][3]

These men were the church sexton Robert Newman and Captain John Pulling—the two of whom historian David Hackett Fischer suggests each carried one lantern up to the steeple—as well as Thomas Bernard, who stood watch for British troops outside the church. The lanterns were displayed to send a warning to Charlestown patriots across the Charles River about the movements of the British Army. Revere and William Dawes would later deliver the same message to Lexington themselves, but this lantern method was a fast way to inform the back-up riders in Charlestown about the movements of the British; these back-up riders planned to deliver the warning message to Lexington and Concord in case Revere and Dawes were arrested on the way.",NONE,the church sexton Robert Newman and Captain John Pulling,,,,,,,,,,,,
